## Governance Model

Babylon follows the **Benevolent Dictator** governance model as described in [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/en/benevolent-dictator.html).

Final decision-making authority rests with one person who, by virtue of personality and experience, is expected to use it wisely. In practice, this means:

- The BD serves as **arbitrator** when consensus cannot be reached
- Day-to-day development proceeds through normal collaborative discussion
- Area maintainers with greater expertise are deferred to in their domains
- The BD facilitates rather than dictates

## Benevolent Dictator

**Persephone Raskova** ([@percy-raskova](https://github.com/percy-raskova))

- Project founder and maintainer
- Final authority on architectural decisions
- Responsible for release management and version control
