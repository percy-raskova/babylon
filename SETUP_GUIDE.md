# Install Babylon

These instructions install Babylon, run two checks, and open the native Bevy
observer game.

Read [`NORTH_STAR.md`](NORTH_STAR.md) for the game purpose, client status,
validation standard, and gate order. [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md)
v4.1.0 is the authority.

## 1. Prepare the host

Babylon development targets Debian Linux. On Windows, use Debian in
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

<!-- Vale: this paragraph preserves literal Docker product and command names. -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO -->
Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
[`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html),
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/), and Docker Engine with the Docker Compose
plug-in from their official guides. Docker Compose is a host prerequisite
because `mise run setup` starts Postgres.
Check them:
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES -->

```bash
git --version
mise --version
rustup --version
docker compose version
```

The repository pins its language tools. It does not install Docker on the host.

Install these Debian packages before `mise run setup`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config git-lfs libssl-dev libpq-dev \
  libasound2-dev libudev-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libx11-dev \
  libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libvulkan-dev mesa-vulkan-drivers
```

## 2. Get Babylon

Clone the repository and select `dev`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/percy-raskova/babylon.git
cd babylon
git checkout dev
```

Trust the local `mise` settings:

```bash
mise trust
```

Read a script before you grant trust when you did not get the clone from the
official repository.

## 3. Install the tools

Run the repository installation task:

```bash
mise run setup
```

The task installs the pinned tools, project dependencies, and local hooks. The
first run can be slow.

Daily development and reference data use the same Python 3.12.14 environment.
Python in `mise.lock` includes SQLite 3.53.1. `uv.lock` pins dependencies.
For reference-data checks, see the
[reference-data instructions](docs/how-to/reference-data-pipeline.rst).

## 4. Open the observer game

<!-- Vale: this paragraph preserves literal Bevy and host package names. -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO -->
<!-- vale ste.NounClusters = NO -->
A Bevy build needs Rust and Cargo plus the host window,
input, and audio development libraries. `rustup` selects the pinned
Rust and Cargo from `rust/rust-toolchain.toml`. The Debian package set
includes `libasound2-dev`, `libudev-dev`, `libwayland-dev`, and
`libxkbcommon-dev`.
<!-- vale ste.NounClusters = YES -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES -->

From the repository root, open or continue a campaign:

```bash
mise run play
```

The launcher builds `babylon-runtime` and `babylon-client` with native Cargo
from `rust/`. It reuses a reachable local database. If the default
database is
unavailable, it starts the repository database with `db:up` and checks again.
By default, the launcher connects to `babylon_test` on `127.0.0.1:5433`.

The runtime initializes a new database, installs the observer read roles,
and connects to Bevy through anonymous pipes. The window receives read
credentials. New campaigns start at period zero. One period advances four weeks
in one simulation tick. The runtime can reopen a supported save from the same
campaign content version. It reconciles the committed checkpoint before the
next period.

Choose **Continue** on the opening warning, then watch or skip the production
card. The Liberty start menu follows:

- **Continue** enters the campaign the launcher prepared or reopened, once ready.
- **New Game** starts the Wayne organizer campaign and preserves existing saves.
- **Load Game** lists saved campaigns, with **Open** and **Compare** controls.
- **Observer Campaigns** offers the regional, statewide, and Wayne maintenance presets.
- **Settings** controls audio, interface size, and reduced motion.
- **Quit** closes the game.

The start menu loops **The Purge**. The production card has its own fanfare.
Music volume cycles through mute, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.
In **Settings**, **Next in-game track** selects the recording to play when you
enter the campaign. Soundtrack recordings play in sequence during a campaign.
Press **Escape** during a campaign to return to the start menu.

The supplied delayed-delivery parameters lengthen the `sheet-transfer` route.
The map shows 83 Michigan county baselines. The production display shows five
Designed county-industry cohorts, actual freight lots, and committed production.
The supplied horizon is 16 four-week periods (64 weeks). Comparing saved
campaigns shows their own committed values; their parameters can differ.

Observed QCEW jobs and wages are source records. Designed physical
quantities and labor-hours use declared scenario values. Observer campaigns
have no player interventions. **New Game** opens the Wayne organizer campaign.

For a new campaign that keeps saved worlds:

```bash
mise run play -- --new
mise run play -- --new --preset delayed
```

Use `--campaign UUID` to open a supported saved campaign. The runtime recovers
its stored scenario and parameters. `--preset` applies only to a new campaign.

Edit `content/scenarios/michigan/defines.toml` before starting a new campaign,
or pass `--defines /absolute/path/to/defines.toml` to choose another file.
Each New request validates and saves those values. Editing the file later does
not change an existing campaign; Open uses its saved values.

Older development saves with unsupported content versions cannot reopen.
Use `mise run play -- --new` to start a new campaign and keep those saves.

The launcher builds native binaries. The `--no-build` option uses the native
binaries on disk.
Use `mise run play` to connect the client to its runtime.

The continuation pointer is a plain UUID in
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/babylon/observer-campaign`, or
`~/.local/state/babylon/observer-campaign` by default.
The pointer is a personal preference. Campaign data stays in Postgres.
The client updates the pointer after the runtime successfully opens or creates
a campaign. A failed New or Open request leaves the previous pointer intact.

For a dedicated local database, set `BABYLON_RUNTIME_DSN` to an explicit
local host, port, database, user, and password before launch. Create that
database first. The launcher refuses an unavailable custom target. It does
not start a different database. It reuses a reachable target and leaves
the shared container unchanged.

To keep that choice for this checkout, put the connection in the `[env]`
section of `.mise.local.toml`, then run `mise trust .mise.local.toml`:

```toml
[env]
BABYLON_RUNTIME_DSN = "host=127.0.0.1 port=5433 dbname=babylon_play user=test password=test"
```

Replace the database and credentials with those of your dedicated database.
The local file stays outside Git.

## 5. Run the repository check

Run the standard local gate:

```bash
mise run check
```

The gate checks format, lint, types, and Python unit contracts. Rust changes
also use the Rust gate:

```bash
mise run rust:check-no-docs
```

Python tests cover retained data tools, operator workflows, and
language-neutral behavior contracts. Rust tests cover mechanics.

## Make a contribution

Read [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.md) before a change. Create a lane from
`dev`, add a failing test first, and open a PR against `dev`.

Use this command for a commit:

```bash
mise run commit -- "type(scope): description"
```

Do not commit directly to `dev` or `main`.

## Fault help

If `mise` is not available after installation, open a new terminal. Then run
`mise --version` again.

If `mise` does not load the repository settings, run `mise trust` from the
repository root.

If `mise run play` reports `CurrentCensusMismatch`, the database does not match
the current schema. Starting a new campaign with `--new` does not replace that
schema. Preserve the database and create a separate database from `template1`
with the current extension installation, then select it with
`BABYLON_RUNTIME_DSN` as described above. The launcher initializes its game tables.
Also check that you are running from the checkout containing the game changes
you want to play.

If dependency installation stops, run `mise run setup` again and keep the first error.
Open an [issue](https://github.com/percy-raskova/babylon/issues) with the command,
host system, and full error text.
