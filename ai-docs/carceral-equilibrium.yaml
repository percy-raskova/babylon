overview: |
  The baseline trajectory when player never organizes. Collapse is inevitable
  (TRPF, peripheral revolt, metabolic rift). The question is HOW it resolves:
  revolutionary transformation or genocidal stabilization.

warsaw_ghetto_dynamic:
  principle: "When prisoners learn genocide is certain, P(S|A) → 0"
  before_knowledge:
    p_s_a: "Some positive value (compliance might work)"
    p_s_r: "Organization / Repression (risky)"
  after_knowledge:
    p_s_a: "→ 0 (compliance = certain death)"
    p_s_r: "Organization / Repression (ONLY chance)"
  implication: "Even atomized prisoners may revolt when facing certain death"
  historical_examples:
    - "Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (1943)"
    - "Sobibor revolt (1943)"
    - "Auschwitz Sonderkommando revolt (1944)"
    - "Treblinka revolt (1943)"

control_ratio_mechanics:
  definition: "Ratio of prisoners to enforcers that guards can maintain control"
  social_not_physical: "Control is maintained through surveillance, atomization, despair, divide-and-conquer"
  current_implementation:
    parameter: "carceral.control_capacity"
    default: 4  # 1:4 ratio
    description: "US national average (BJS data)"
  breakpoint: "When organization >= 0.5, control mechanisms fail"
  implemented_in: "src/babylon/engine/systems/control_ratio.py"

enforcer_radicalization:
  description: "Guards are former LA members, not ideologically committed. Moral injury accumulates."
  pathway:
    - "Guard witnesses atrocities"
    - "Cognitive dissonance accumulates"
    - "Contact with organized prisoners (solidarity transmission)"
    - "Guard flips: provides intel, opens doors, joins revolt"
  historical_examples:
    - "Schindler, Wallenberg"
    - "Prison guard unions supporting prisoner rights"
    - "Fragging in Vietnam"
  status: "EPOCH 2 - enforcer consciousness mechanic planned"

economics:
  costs_per_tick:
    - "enforcer_wages = enforcers × wage_rate"
    - "prisoner_subsistence = prisoners × minimal_rations"
    - "infrastructure = fixed_overhead"
  income_per_tick:
    - "prison_labor = prisoners × labor_productivity × hours (minimal)"
  sustainability: "C_b initial wealth + cumulative income >= cumulative costs"
  equilibrium_state:
    - "prisoners = enforcers × CONTROL_CAPACITY (at limit)"
    - "costs ≈ income (slow drain)"
    - "organization < 0.5 (no revolt)"
    - "Periodic culling when ratio exceeds capacity"
