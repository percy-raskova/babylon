  title: SQLite instead of PostgreSQL
  context: 'Initially configured PostgreSQL, but this is a local game

    with no multi-user requirements.

    '
  decision: Use SQLite for all persistent storage
  rationale:
  - No server to manage
  - Zero configuration
  - Portable game saves (single file)
  - Sufficient performance for single-player
  consequences:
    positive:
    - Simpler deployment
    - No external dependencies
    negative:
    - Can't easily add multiplayer later
    - No concurrent writes (not needed)
