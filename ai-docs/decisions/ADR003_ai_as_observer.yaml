  title: AI generates narrative, never controls mechanics
  context: 'LLMs are non-deterministic. Game mechanics must be

    reproducible and testable.

    '
  decision: 'AI sits in Archive layer only. It can:

    - Query state and history

    - Generate narrative text

    It cannot:

    - Modify game state

    - Determine mechanical outcomes

    '
  rationale:
  - Deterministic mechanics enable testing
  - Reproducible gameplay
  - AI failures don't break game
  - Separation of narration from simulation
  consequences:
    positive:
    - Game works without AI
    - Testable mechanics
    negative:
    - Less emergent AI behavior
    - More explicit mechanics required
