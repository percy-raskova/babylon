  title: JSON for game data instead of XML
  context: 'Legacy data was in XML. Need machine-readable format

    that''s easy to validate and work with.

    '
  decision: Migrate all game data to JSON with JSON Schema validation
  rationale:
  - Native Python support (json module)
  - JSON Schema provides validation
  - Easier to read/write programmatically
  - Better tooling ecosystem
  consequences:
    positive:
    - Schema validation catches errors early
    - Cleaner data structures
    negative:
    - Migration effort (completed)
    - XML kept as reference (minor storage cost)
