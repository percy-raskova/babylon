  title: Game logic in data, not code
  context: 'Game has many entities with varying behaviors. Hardcoding

    each case leads to unmaintainable code.

    '
  decision: 'Define game rules in data files (JSON/TOML).

    Code provides engine, data provides content.

    '
  rationale:
  - Easy content modification
  - Modding support
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Non-programmers can adjust balance
  consequences:
    positive:
    - Flexible content
    - Moddable
    negative:
    - More complex data structures
    - Data validation critical
