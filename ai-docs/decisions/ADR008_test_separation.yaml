  title: Separate fast tests from AI tests
  context: 'AI tests are slow and non-deterministic.

    Logic tests should be fast and reliable.

    '
  decision: 'Use pytest markers to separate:

    - math, ledger, topology: fast, deterministic

    - ai: slow, can be flaky

    '
  rationale:
  - Fast feedback loop for logic changes
  - CI can run fast tests on every commit
  - AI tests run less frequently
  consequences:
    positive:
    - Fast TDD cycle
    - Clear test categories
    negative:
    - Must remember to run both
