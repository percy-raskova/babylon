  title: 'The Fascist Bifurcation: Solidarity as Infrastructure'
  context: 'Sprint 3.4.2 implemented Proletarian Internationalism, but a critical design

    question emerged: should solidarity_strength be auto-calculated from source

    organization, or stored as a persistent edge attribute?


    Historical observation: Accelerationist strategies (crash the economy to

    trigger revolution) consistently produce fascism, not socialism. Germany 1933,

    Italy 1922, Spain 1936. Why?


    Answer: Material disruption (wage decline) creates "agitation energy" that

    has NO INHERENT DIRECTION. It can flow toward class consciousness OR toward

    national chauvinism/scapegoating. The direction depends on PRE-EXISTING

    solidarity infrastructure (unions, internationals, worker organizations).


    If solidarity infrastructure exists: agitation → class awakening → revolution

    If solidarity infrastructure absent: agitation → fascist turn → reaction


    This is the core insight of anti-accelerationism in MLM-TW theory.

    '
  decision: 'Store solidarity_strength as a PERSISTENT EDGE ATTRIBUTE, not auto-calculated.


    Field: Relationship.solidarity_strength: Coefficient = Field(default=0.0)


    Key semantics:

    - solidarity_strength = 0.0 means NO solidarity infrastructure

    - Must be BUILT through player/system actions (like the 3rd International)

    - High organization without solidarity infrastructure = Fascist Bifurcation risk


    Formula: dΨ_target = σ_edge × (Ψ_source - Ψ_target)

    - σ_edge is READ FROM EDGE DATA, not calculated from source

    - If σ_edge = 0: no transmission even if source is revolutionary

    - This creates the Fascist Bifurcation branch point

    '
  rationale:
  - Encodes anti-accelerationist theory into mechanics
  - Enables emergent Fascist vs Revolutionary outcomes from same starting conditions
  - 'Player agency: must choose to BUILD solidarity before crisis'
  - 'Historical accuracy: 3rd International had to be ORGANIZED'
  - Same code produces both outcomes based on prior state
  implementation:
    location: src/babylon/models/entities/relationship.py
    formula: src/babylon/systems/formulas.py:calculate_solidarity_transmission()
    system: src/babylon/engine/systems/solidarity.py
    tests: tests/unit/engine/systems/test_solidarity_system.py
  scenarios:
    revolutionary_outcome: 'Setup: P_w (Ψ=0.9), C_w (Ψ=0.1), SOLIDARITY edge (σ=0.8)

      Transmission: delta = 0.8 × (0.9 - 0.1) = 0.64

      Result: C_w awakens, revolutionary consciousness spreads

      Historical analogue: International solidarity during 1917-1919

      '
    fascist_outcome: 'Setup: P_w (Ψ=0.9), C_w (Ψ=0.1), SOLIDARITY edge (σ=0.0)

      Transmission: delta = 0.0 × (0.9 - 0.1) = 0.0

      Result: C_w loses wages but has no class explanation

      Scapegoating fills the void → Fascist turn

      Historical analogue: Germany 1929-1933

      '
  consequences:
    positive:
    - Emergent political outcomes from same economic crisis
    - Player must invest in solidarity BEFORE crisis
    - Encodes 'accelerationism produces fascism' as game mechanic
    - 'Historically accurate: internationals were BUILT, not automatic'
    negative:
    - More edge state to manage
    - Requires UI to show solidarity infrastructure status
  mantra: Agitation without solidarity produces fascism, not revolution.
