  title: Fractal Topology for Internal Colonies
  context: 'The 4-node Imperial Circuit (P_w, P_c, C_b, C_w) models Core-Periphery

    dynamics but treats the Core as monolithic. In reality, the Core contains

    "Internal Colonies" - stratified populations with different relationships

    to imperial rent.


    Examples:

    - Black Americans: super-exploitation within Core, lower access to imperial rent

    - Women workers: gendered wage gap, unpaid reproductive labor

    - Rural workers: geographic stratification, deindustrialized regions

    - Immigrant workers: legal precarity, wage depression


    These groups experience "Periphery-like" conditions within the Core.

    The graph needs to model this without code explosion.

    '
  decision: 'Use Composite/Graph pattern for fractal topology:

    1. C_w node can be EXPANDED into sub-graph when needed

    2. Sub-nodes (C_w_black, C_w_white, C_w_immigrant, etc.) inherit from parent

    3. Edges can cross fractal levels (C_b → C_w_black)

    4. Aggregation: collapsed C_w = weighted sum of sub-nodes


    Pattern:

    - Phase 3.4: Single C_w node (current)

    - Phase 5: Expand C_w into Internal Colony sub-graph

    - Same engine code works at any fractal level

    '
  rationale:
  - Models real stratification without monolithic code changes
  - Enables 'zoom in' mechanics for UI
  - Same formulas apply at every fractal level
  - Captures 'internal colonization' of oppressed groups
  - 'Graph-native: NetworkX supports subgraphs naturally'
  implementation_sketch:
    pattern: Composite Design Pattern + NetworkX subgraph
    expansion: "# Phase 5 implementation\nC_w_expanded = {\n  \"C_w_white\": {..., parent: \"C_w\", weight: 0.6},\n  \"C_w_black\"\
      : {..., parent: \"C_w\", weight: 0.13},\n  \"C_w_latino\": {..., parent: \"C_w\", weight: 0.19},\n  \"C_w_immigrant\"\
      : {..., parent: \"C_w\", weight: 0.08},\n}\n"
    aggregation: 'C_w_aggregate = Σ(sub_node.wealth × sub_node.weight)

      '
  blockers:
  - Phase 3.4 Multi-Dimensional Consciousness must be complete
  - Phase 4 UI needed to visualize fractal zoom
  consequences:
    positive:
    - Models Internal Colonies without special-casing
    - Same engine handles any fractal depth
    - Enables future complexity scaling
    - Graph is already the right data structure
    negative:
    - Aggregation complexity increases
    - UI must handle variable graph depth
    - Testing surface grows with fractal levels

    - 'Settlers: The Mythology of the White Proletariat (J. Sakai)'
    - Black Reconstruction in America (W.E.B. Du Bois)
    - Caliban and the Witch (Silvia Federici)
    insight: 'The white working class in America has historically been granted

      "psychological wage" (Du Bois) - a sense of superiority that

      compensates for economic exploitation. This is the "internal

      stratification" that fractal topology must model.
