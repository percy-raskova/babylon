  title: NiceGUI (Native Mode) with Tailwind CSS
  context: 'Requirement for "Bunker Constructivism" aesthetic and async simulation loop.

    Target is Steam executable via pywebview wrapper.


    Options evaluated:

    - NiceGUI (web mode): Browser-based, good for development

    - NiceGUI (native mode): pywebview wrapper, standalone .exe

    - Tkinter: Native Python GUI, limited styling

    - PyQt/PySide: Heavy dependency, complex licensing

    '
  decision: 'Use NiceGUI in Native Mode (pywebview) with Tailwind CSS styling.

    Deprecate all Tkinter/pack patterns from documentation.


    Key patterns:

    - Root function mode (per ADR026)

    - Tailwind utility classes for all styling

    - Component class strings defined in ai-docs/design-system.yaml

    - CRT overlay effect via CSS pseudo-elements

    '
  rationale:
  - Native async support for EventBus integration
  - Tailwind enables 'CSS painting' for specific Bunker aesthetic
  - Native mode provides .exe wrapper for Steam distribution
  - Root function pattern already validated (ADR026)
  - Single codebase for dev (web) and release (native)
  deprecates:
  - All Tkinter references in docs/how-to/gui-development.rst
  - pack/grid geometry manager patterns
  - Soviet Red color scheme (replaced by Bunker Constructivism)
  implementation:
    design_system: ai-docs/design-system.yaml
    ui_code: src/babylon/ui/
    aesthetic_spec: brainstorm/ui/digital-grow-room.md
  consequences:
    positive:
    - Modern CSS capabilities via Tailwind
    - Consistent styling via design-system.yaml
    - Async-native matches simulation EventBus
    - Easy Steam distribution via pywebview
    negative:
    - Requires web runtime (Chromium via pywebview)
    - Larger binary than pure Tkinter
    - Learning curve for Tailwind utility classes
