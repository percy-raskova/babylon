# =============================================================================
# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION: THE METABOLIC RIFT
# =============================================================================

theory:
  name: "Marxist-Malthusian Demographic Engine"

  critique_of_malthus:
    vulgar_malthusianism: |
      Standard 4X games model population through "carrying capacity" - a fixed
      number of people a territory can support. This leads to fascistic logic:
      "There are too many people, therefore some must die/leave."

      This is ideological mystification. It treats population as the CAUSE of
      resource scarcity, rather than the EFFECT of social organization.

    the_real_question: |
      The question is never "how many people can the land support?" but rather:
      "WHO consumes HOW MUCH of WHAT?"

      A territory that "cannot support" 10,000 subsistence farmers can easily
      support 100 billionaires - because the billionaires extract resources
      from OTHER territories via imperial rent.

    marxist_correction: |
      Population pressure is a function of:
      1. CLASS CONSUMPTION PATTERNS (not raw headcount)
      2. METABOLIC RIFT (extraction vs regeneration)
      3. IMPERIAL RENT FLOWS (subsidizing core consumption)

      The simulation must track the COST OF REPRODUCING STYLES OF LIFE,
      not just biological organisms.

  metabolic_rift:
    definition: |
      The "Metabolic Rift" (John Bellamy Foster, following Marx) describes
      the rupture in the natural nutrient cycle caused by capitalist agriculture.

      Under capitalism, nutrients flow ONE WAY: from soil to city to sewer.
      There is no return flow. The rift widens until the soil is exhausted.

    generalized_form: |
      We generalize this to ALL resource cycles:
      - Labor power extracted, not restored (burnout, disability, death)
      - Ecosystems extracted, not regenerated (deforestation, fishery collapse)
      - Social bonds extracted, not maintained (atomization, anomie)

      The rift is the GAP between what is taken and what is restored.

    simulation_implication: |
      Population is limited not by SPACE but by RIFT.
      A territory with high extraction and low restoration will collapse
      regardless of physical size. A territory with balanced flows can
      sustain population indefinitely.

# =============================================================================
# CLASS-BASED CONSUMPTION MODEL
# =============================================================================

class_consumption:
  principle: |
    "Subsistence" is not a biological constant but a CLASS POSITION.

    A proletarian needs calories to survive.
    A labor aristocrat needs calories PLUS consumer goods PLUS healthcare
    PLUS education for children PLUS retirement savings.

    The "American Dream" is a specific S_class value - the cost of
    reproducing a particular lifestyle. When imperial rent shrinks,
    this S_class becomes unaffordable, triggering crisis.

  subsistence_split:
    S_bio:
      symbol: "S_bio"
      definition: "Biological Subsistence"
      description: |
        The absolute minimum consumption required to not die.
        Calories, clean water, basic shelter, minimal healthcare.
        This is the FLOOR - below this, mortality spikes.
      unit: "Currency"
      typical_value: 0.01
      political_meaning: |
        S_bio is what remains when all else is stripped away.
        Fascism operates by denying S_bio to "surplus populations."

    S_class:
      symbol: "S_class"
      definition: "Social Reproduction"
      description: |
        The consumption required to reproduce a CLASS POSITION.
        Includes S_bio plus class-specific commodities:
        - Education (reproducing skills)
        - Healthcare (reproducing labor capacity)
        - Consumer goods (reproducing social status)
        - Housing (reproducing spatial position)
        - Leisure (reproducing mental health)
      unit: "Currency"
      formula: "S_class = S_bio + S_status + S_skills + S_health"
      political_meaning: |
        S_class is what must be consumed to remain in one's class.
        Downward mobility = S_class becoming unaffordable.
        The "middle class squeeze" is S_class inflation outpacing wages.

    S_imperial:
      symbol: "S_imperial"
      definition: "Imperial Subsidy Component"
      description: |
        The portion of S_class funded by imperial rent extraction.
        This is the "cheap goods" effect - consumer products made
        affordable by peripheral super-exploitation.
      unit: "Currency"
      formula: "S_imperial = S_class - S_domestic"
      political_meaning: |
        S_imperial is the material basis of labor aristocracy loyalty.
        When imperial rent shrinks, S_imperial collapses, and the
        "American lifestyle" becomes unaffordable.

        This is why core workers support imperialism:
        their S_class DEPENDS on peripheral extraction.

  the_american_problem:
    description: |
      The United States consumes approximately 25% of global resources
      with 4% of global population. This is not "overpopulation" -
      it is CLASS CONSUMPTION INEQUALITY.

      The simulation must ask: "What is the S_class of the American
      working class, and what imperial rent flow sustains it?"

    formalization: |
      Let:
        Pop_core = Core population
        Pop_periphery = Periphery population
        S_class_core = Core class consumption (high)
        S_bio_periphery = Periphery biological consumption (low)

      Global consumption = (Pop_core * S_class_core) + (Pop_periphery * S_bio_periphery)

      The "population problem" is actually a S_class problem:
      reducing S_class_core would do more than eliminating Pop_periphery.

    status: "PLANNED"
    description: |
      The fundamental demographic equation. Biocapacity changes each tick
      based on the balance between regeneration and extraction.

      When ΔB < 0: The rift widens. Territory is being depleted.
      When ΔB > 0: The rift heals. Territory is regenerating.
      When ΔB = 0: Sustainable equilibrium (rare under capitalism).

      description: "Net change in biocapacity (positive = regeneration, negative = rift)"

    key_insight: |
      The rift is NOT a fixed "carrying capacity."
      It is a DYNAMIC BALANCE that humans can shift in either direction.

      Capitalism systematically maximizes E_extract and minimizes L_restore,
      widening the rift until crisis forces resolution.

      equilibrium: "[-0.1, 0.1]"
      deficit: "< -0.1"
      crisis: "< -0.3"

    key_insight: |
      This is where the "population problem" reveals its class character.
      A deficit can be resolved by:
      1. Reducing Pop (Malthusian - kill people)
      2. Reducing S_class (Socialist - redistribute)
      3. Increasing B (Ecological - restore)
      4. Stealing B from elsewhere (Imperial - extract)

      Capitalism chooses (4), then (1). Never (2) or (3).

# =============================================================================
# THE FASCIST BIFURCATION (DEMOGRAPHIC)
# =============================================================================

fascist_bifurcation:
  principle: |
    When Global_Consumption > Global_Biocapacity, the system enters
    demographic crisis. There are only three ways to resolve this:

    1. FASCIST SOLUTION: Eliminate S_bio of "surplus populations"
       (Let periphery die to protect core S_class)

    2. SOCIALIST SOLUTION: Eliminate S_class luxury consumption
       (Redistribute from rich to poor, maximize L_restore)

    3. IMPERIAL SOLUTION: Externalize the rift
       (Extract from colonies, defer crisis to future)

    The simulation must model all three pathways and their consequences.

  crisis_trigger:
    condition: "consumption_balance < CRISIS_THRESHOLD"
    effects:
      - "EventType.DEMOGRAPHIC_CRISIS emitted"
      - "Bourgeoisie forced to choose resolution pathway"
      - "Class tensions spike across all relationships"

  resolution_pathways:

    fascist_solution:
      name: "Necropolitical Resolution"
      description: |
        The fascist solution to demographic crisis is to ELIMINATE the
        biological subsistence of "surplus populations." This is not
        metaphorical - it is literal mass death through:
        - Denial of food aid
        - Medical apartheid
        - Environmental sacrifice zones
        - Border militarization (let migrants drown)
        - Carceral disposal (mass incarceration as slow death)

      mechanism: |
        Reduce Global_Consumption by setting S_bio = 0 for
        PERIPHERY_PROLETARIAT nodes in selected territories.
        This kills population but "balances" the equation.

      formula: "Pop_eliminated = (Deficit / S_bio_periphery)"

      political_meaning: |
        "Life unworthy of life." The simulation makes explicit what
        fascism mystifies: the material basis of genocide.

      narrative_flag: "NECROPOLITICS_ACTIVE"

    socialist_solution:
      name: "Redistributive Resolution"
      description: |
        The socialist solution is to resolve the deficit by eliminating
        S_class luxury consumption (austerity for the RICH) and
        maximizing Labor_Restoration (ecological repair).

      mechanism: |
        Reduce S_class for BOURGEOISIE and LABOR_ARISTOCRACY to
        approach S_bio levels. Redirect surplus to L_restore.

      formula: "S_class_new = S_bio + (S_class_old - S_bio) * austerity_factor"

      political_meaning: |
        "From each according to ability, to each according to need."
        No one dies, but lifestyles change dramatically.

      narrative_flag: "REDISTRIBUTION_ACTIVE"

    imperial_solution:
      name: "Externalization Resolution"
      description: |
        The imperial solution is to STEAL biocapacity from elsewhere.
        This defers the crisis but does not resolve it - the rift
        simply widens in the periphery.

      mechanism: |
        Transfer Biocapacity stock from PERIPHERY territories to CORE.
        Increase E_extract on peripheral nodes.

      formula: "B_transfer = Deficit * imperial_extraction_rate"

      political_meaning: |
        The classic colonial "solution" - export the crisis.
        This is why climate change hits the Global South first.

      narrative_flag: "IMPERIAL_EXTRACTION_INTENSIFIED"

  decision_logic:
    description: |
      The bourgeoisie choose resolution pathway based on:
      1. Imperial rent availability (can we externalize?)
      2. Core class consciousness (will they accept redistribution?)
      3. Peripheral resistance (can we eliminate without backlash?)

    decision_tree: |
      IF imperial_rent_pool > Deficit:
        → IMPERIAL_SOLUTION (externalize)
      ELSE IF core_consciousness > 0.5:
        → SOCIALIST_SOLUTION (forced redistribution)
      ELSE:
        → FASCIST_SOLUTION (necropolitics)

    key_insight: |
      Fascism is the DEFAULT resolution when imperialism fails and
      socialism is blocked. This is why fascism rises during
      imperial decline - the externalization option closes.

# NARRATIVE IMPLICATIONS

narrative_implications:
  purpose: |
    The AI Narrator (Bondi Algorithm) must describe demographic shifts
    in materialist terms, never Malthusian mystification. The narrative
    should reveal the CLASS CHARACTER of population dynamics.

  vocabulary:
    avoid:
      - "overpopulation"
      - "carrying capacity exceeded"
      - "too many people"
      - "population bomb"
      - "unsustainable population growth"
      - "demographic pressure"

    prefer:
      - "metabolic rift widening"
      - "consumption deficit"
      - "class reproduction crisis"
      - "extraction exceeds regeneration"
      - "biocapacity depletion"

  key_narrative_principles:

    never_blame_population: |
      The narrative must NEVER frame the crisis as "too many people."
      Always frame as "too much consumption by too few" or
      "extraction without restoration."

    reveal_class_character: |
      Every demographic event should expose the CLASS distribution
      of consumption. "X% of consumption by Y% of population."

    name_the_mechanism: |
      Fascist solutions must be named explicitly:
      - "S_bio denial"
      - "Necropolitical resolution"
      - "Sacrifice zone designation"
      Never euphemize mass death.

    show_alternatives: |
      When fascist resolution occurs, narrative should note:
      "Alternative: {socialist_resolution} was available but blocked
      by {blocking_factor}."

  key_quotes:
    metabolic_rift: |
      "Capitalist production... disturbs the metabolic interaction between man
      and the earth, i.e., it prevents the return to the soil of its
      constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing;
      hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condition for
      the lasting fertility of the soil." - Marx, Capital Vol. 1

    necropolitics: |
      "The ultimate expression of sovereignty resides, to a large degree,
      in the power and the capacity to dictate who may live and who must die."
      - Achille Mbembe, Necropolitics

    superwages: |
      "The US working class as a whole is not exploited; it participates in
      the exploitation of the Third World... The average American lives at
      the expense of other peoples." - Zak Cope, Divided World Divided Class

  design_principle: |
    This system exists to make the MATERIAL BASIS of fascism explicit.

    Fascism is not "irrational hatred" - it is a RATIONAL response to
    demographic crisis when imperialism fails and socialism is blocked.
    The player must understand: fascism emerges from the logic of
    class consumption inequality, not from "bad ideas."

    The simulation should create moments where the player sees:
    "If I don't redistribute, these people will die. If I do redistribute,
    I lose the labor aristocracy. What do I choose?"

    That is the Fascist Bifurcation made playable.
