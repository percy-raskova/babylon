  description: |
    The UI is a physical CRT monitor in a damp basement. You are the virus
    in the machine, the internal contradiction growing revolution in the
    basement of empire. Jury-rigged high-tech: GPUs cooling in a damp
    basement, purple LED grow lights reflecting off CRT monitors, terminal
    green data streams.

# PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================

philosophy:
  name: "Bunker Constructivism"
  tagline: "The Screen is a Physical Object"
  description: |
    This is not a clean web app. This is a CRT monitor in a basement,
    humming with static, casting purple grow-light reflections.
    The UI should feel:
    - Heavy (metal chassis, not floating cards)
    - Old (CRT grain, not retina-sharp)
    - Alive (flickering, breathing, not static)
    - Underground (hidden, illicit, insurgent)

  influences:
    - "Soviet Constructivism (geometric, propagandistic)"
    - "Brutalist architecture (raw concrete, exposed structure)"
    - "Cyberpunk terminals (green phosphor, scanlines)"
    - "Hydroponic grow rooms (purple LEDs, life in darkness)"
