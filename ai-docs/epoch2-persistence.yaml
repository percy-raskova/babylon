      summary: |
        Add Faction nodes with colonial_stance (UPHOLD/IGNORE/ABOLISH) to model the
        settler-colonial dimension of political struggle. Implements the "Red Settler Trap"
        where settler-socialist factions can win the revolution but lose the planet.

# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================

overview:
  thesis: |
    Epoch 2 models the full United States as a battleground. This requires ~74,000
    Territory nodes (50 states + 3,000 counties + 70,000 cities/townships) with
    both administrative hierarchy (who governs what) and physical adjacency
    (what borders what).

    Pure NetworkX cannot handle this scale in RAM. We bifurcate the architecture:
    - **KuzuDB**: Disk-backed "Strategic Map" storing the complete world
    - **NetworkX**: In-memory "Tactical Cache" for active simulation sectors

  key_concepts:
    strategic_map:
      storage: "KuzuDB (embedded graph database)"
      contains: "Complete World Graph + Historical Chronicle"
      scale: "74,000+ nodes, disk-backed"
      queries: "Cypher-like syntax for complex graph traversal"

    tactical_cache:
      storage: "NetworkX (in-memory)"
      contains: "Active Sector (subset being simulated)"
      scale: "100-1,000 nodes per sector"
      purpose: "Fast tick calculations, unchanged from Epoch 1"

    hydration:
      definition: "Loading nodes from Strategic Map into Tactical Cache"
      trigger: "Player action, conflict expansion, or sector boundary crossing"

    flush:
      definition: "Writing Tactical Cache changes back to Strategic Map"
      trigger: "End of tick, checkpoint, or sector transition"

    # === Dynamic Sovereignty (v1.1.0) ===
    dynamic_sovereignty:
      definition: "Sovereignty as graph edges, not node properties"
      principle: |
        The Land (physical mesh) and the State (sovereignty claims) are independent layers.
        A mountain range doesn't care who claims sovereignty over it.
      layers:
        land_layer:
          edges: "ADJACENT_TO"
          nature: "Immutable geography - physical borders, terrain"
          changes: "Only via geological/construction events (rare)"
        state_layer:
          edges: "CLAIMS (Sovereign → Territory)"
          nature: "Mutable politics - who governs what"
          changes: "O(1) edge rewiring for secession, conquest, revolution"

    sovereign:
      definition: "A political entity capable of claiming sovereignty over Territory"
      examples:
        - "United States Federal Government"
        - "Provisional Revolutionary Command"
        - "California Republic (post-secession)"
        - "Occupied Zone Administration"

    fracture_operation:
      definition: "Sovereignty transfer via edge manipulation"
      steps:
        - "Delete or reduce control_level on old Sovereign→Territory CLAIMS edge"
        - "Create new CLAIMS edge from new Sovereign to Territory"
      complexity: "O(1) - pure graph rewiring, no node property changes"

  Faction:
    description: |
      Political formations that can contest sovereignty. Factions are distinct from
      Sovereigns—a Faction can exist without holding power, and a Sovereign's behavior
      is determined by its ruling Faction.

      The critical property is `colonial_stance`, which determines the faction's
      relationship to settler colonialism and, consequently, its extraction_policy
      when ruling.

      The Three Stances:
      - UPHOLD: Explicitly defend settler sovereignty (Fascists, Liberals)
      - IGNORE: Focus on class, ignore land (Settler-Socialists) ← THE TRAP

  # CLAIMS (v1.1.0 - Dynamic Sovereignty)
  # ===========================================================================

  CLAIMS:
    description: |
      Represents a sovereignty claim from a Sovereign to a Territory. This is the
      core of the Dynamic Sovereignty system.

      Key Properties:
      - A Territory can have MULTIPLE CLAIMS edges (contested territory)
      - Only ONE claim should have control_level >= 0.5 at a time (effective control)
      - Sovereignty changes are O(1) edge operations (delete old, create new)

      Examples:
      - (SOV_USA_FED) -[:CLAIMS]-> (US-CA)  # USA claims California
      - (SOV_PRC) -[:CLAIMS]-> (US-CA-037)  # Revolutionary Command claims LA County
      - Dual power: Both edges exist with different control_levels

      Fracture Operation (Secession):
      ```cypher
      // Step 1: Reduce USA control over California
      MATCH (usa:Sovereign {id: 'SOV_USA_FED'})-[c:CLAIMS]->(ca:Territory {id: 'US-CA'})
      SET c.control_level = 0.1, c.legal_status = 'DISPUTED'

      // Step 2: Create California Republic claim
      MATCH (cal:Sovereign {id: 'SOV_CAL_REP'})
      MATCH (ca:Territory {id: 'US-CA'})
      CREATE (cal)-[:CLAIMS {control_level: 0.9, legal_status: 'DE_FACTO'}]->(ca)

  # INFLUENCES (v1.2.0 - Balkanization System)
  # ===========================================================================

  INFLUENCES:
    description: |
      Represents a Faction's influence over a Territory. Factions build influence
      through organizing, propaganda, and material support. When a Sovereign collapses,
      the Faction with highest total influence over contested territories takes power.

      Key Properties:
      - Multiple Factions can INFLUENCE the same Territory
      - Influence does NOT equal control (that's CLAIMS)
      - When a Sovereign fails, INFLUENCES edges determine successor

      The Collapse Transition:
      1. Sovereign loses control_level < 0.2 (legitimacy crisis)
      2. Query: Which Faction has highest SUM(INFLUENCES.influence_level) to contested territories?
      3. Create new Sovereign with ruling_faction_id = winning Faction
      4. New Sovereign inherits extraction_policy from Faction's colonial_stance

      # === SCENARIO COMMENTARY ===
      scenario_notes: |
        This test fixture demonstrates THE RED SETTLER TRAP:

        1. If USA collapses in LA County, Workers' Congress wins (0.7 > 0.3)
        2. New Sovereign gets extraction_policy: CONTINUE (from IGNORE stance)
        3. Habitability continues to degrade (-0.005/tick)
        4. Player experiences "false summit" - won the revolution, losing the planet

        To achieve TRUE victory:
        - Player must actively support Decolonial Front (build INFLUENCES edges)
        - Flip LA County so Decolonial has majority when collapse occurs
        - New Sovereign then gets extraction_policy: CEASE
        - Only then can habitability recover (+0.01/tick)
