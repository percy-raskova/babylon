# These are critical pitfalls discovered during fascist soundtrack generation.
# ALWAYS reference this section before writing new MIDI generators.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # MIDIUTIL API GOTCHAS
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  track_vs_channel:
    severity: critical
    error: "IndexError: list index out of range"
    cause: |
      midiutil.addNote(track, channel, pitch, time, duration, velocity)
      The FIRST parameter is TRACK NUMBER (0-indexed into MIDIFile's track list).
      The SECOND parameter is MIDI CHANNEL (0-15).
      These are DIFFERENT concepts that are often confused!
    solution: |
      # WRONG - using channel 9 as track number
      midi = MIDIFile(5)  # Only 5 tracks (0-4)
      midi.addNote(9, 9, 36, 0, 1, 80)  # ERROR: track 9 doesn't exist!

      # CORRECT - separate track and channel constants
      TRACK_DRUMS = 5           # Track index in our MIDIFile
      MIDI_DRUM_CHANNEL = 9     # Standard GM percussion channel
      midi = MIDIFile(6)        # Create 6 tracks (0-5)
      midi.addNote(TRACK_DRUMS, MIDI_DRUM_CHANNEL, 36, 0, 1, 80)  # Works!

  deinterleave_false:
    severity: high
    issue: "Notes not playing correctly or overlapping strangely"
    solution: |
      Always create MIDIFile with deinterleave=False:
      midi = MIDIFile(num_tracks, deinterleave=False)
      This prevents midiutil from reordering note events.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # MODULE STRUCTURE GOTCHAS
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  relative_imports:
    severity: critical
    error: "ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package"
    cause: |
      Python relative imports (from . import X) only work when:
      1. The file is part of a proper package (has __init__.py)
      2. The file is imported as a module, not run directly
      Running `python tools/fascist_soundtrack/generate_01.py` directly FAILS.
    solutions:
      option_1_module: |
        # Run as module from project root
        cd babylon
        poetry run python -m tools.fascist_soundtrack.generate_01

      option_2_standalone: |
        # Create standalone script with all code inline
        # No imports from sibling modules
        # Put shared constants directly in the file

      option_3_path_hack: |
        # Add parent to path (less clean but works)
        import sys
        from pathlib import Path
        sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))
        from __init__ import *  # Now works as absolute import

    recommendation: |
      For tools that users run directly, use standalone scripts.
      Modular structure is cleaner but harder to execute.
      The fascist soundtrack uses a single generate_fascist_soundtrack.py
      with all code inline to avoid import issues.

  __file__in_exec:
    severity: medium
    error: "NameError: name '__file__' is not defined"
    cause: |
      Using exec(open('file.py').read()) loses __file__ context.
      Any code using __file__ for path resolution will fail.
    solution: |
      Don't use exec() for testing. Run the file directly:
      poetry run python tools/generate_fascist_soundtrack.py

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # NOTE DEFINITION GOTCHAS
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  missing_notes:
    severity: high
    error: "NameError: name 'Eb5' is not defined"
    cause: |
      When defining chromatic notes, easy to miss octaves.
      Defined Eb3, Eb4 but forgot Eb5.
    solution: |
      Define ALL chromatic notes across ALL octaves you'll use:

      # Chromatic notes - BE EXHAUSTIVE
      Bb1, Bb2, Bb3, Bb4, Bb5 = 34, 46, 58, 70, 82
      Db2, Db3, Db4, Db5 = 37, 49, 61, 73
      Eb2, Eb3, Eb4, Eb5 = 39, 51, 63, 75
      # etc.

      Or use a helper function:
      def note(name, octave):
          base = {'C':0,'Db':1,'D':2,'Eb':3,'E':4,'F':5,'Gb':6,'G':7,'Ab':8,'A':9,'Bb':10,'B':11}
          return base[name] + (octave + 1) * 12

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # FILE SIZE / CONTENT GOTCHAS
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  sparse_tracks:
    severity: medium
    symptom: "MIDI file suspiciously small (< 1KB for a 5-minute track)"
    causes:
      - "Ambient/sparse tracks ARE legitimately small"
      - "Notes outside valid time range (beat > total_bars * 4)"
      - "Velocity = 0 (silent notes)"
      - "Duration = 0 (no sound)"
    diagnosis: |
      # Quick note count check
      poetry run python -c "
      import struct
      with open('track.mid', 'rb') as f:
          data = f.read()
      note_ons = sum(1 for i in range(len(data)-2) if 0x90 <= data[i] <= 0x9F)
      print(f'Note-on events: {note_ons}')
      "
    reference: |
      Dense tracks (mechanical patterns): 2000+ notes, 15-30KB
      Moderate tracks: 500-1500 notes, 8-15KB
      Sparse/ambient tracks: 50-200 notes, 1-3KB (INTENTIONAL)

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # GENERAL BEST PRACTICES
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  best_practices:
    - "Always verify track count matches highest track index + 1"
    - "Use named constants for both tracks AND channels"
    - "Test each track generator individually before batch run"
    - "Check file sizes after generation - sparse isn't always wrong"
    - "Run from project root with poetry run python path/to/script.py"
    - "For standalone scripts, inline all dependencies"

# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================
#
# Babylon uses procedural MIDI generation to create thematic music that
# reflects the game's MLM-TW theoretical framework. Each piece encodes
# dialectical concepts through musical structure.
#
# Philosophy: Music is ideology made audible. The soundtrack should make
# players FEEL the theory before they understand it intellectually.

# =============================================================================
# TECHNOLOGY STACK
# =============================================================================

dependencies:
  midiutil: "1.2.1"  # Core MIDI file generation
  description: |
    MIDIFile class provides low-level MIDI file creation.
    No external synthesizers required - outputs standard .mid files.
    Players use system MIDI playback or DAW software.

playback_options:
  - fluidsynth: "Command-line synthesizer, requires SoundFont"
  - vlc: "Plays MIDI directly (quality varies)"
  - daw: "Import into any DAW for high-quality rendering"
  - browser: "Web MIDI API for in-game playback"

# =============================================================================
# GENERATION PATTERN
# =============================================================================

file_structure:
  location: "tools/generate_*.py"
  output: "assets/music/*.mid"

code_pattern: |
  # 1. Define constants
  TEMPO = 76          # BPM - narrative meaning in tempo choice
  TOTAL_BARS = 32     # Structure length

  # 2. Define MIDI channels (one per instrument voice)
  CH_PIANO = 0
  CH_BASS = 1
  # ... etc

  # 3. Define GM program numbers
  PROG_PIANO = 0      # General MIDI instrument codes
  PROG_CELLO = 42

  # 4. Define scale/mode as named note constants
  D2, E2, F2, G2 = 38, 40, 41, 43   # MIDI note numbers

  # 5. Create MIDIFile with track count
  midi = MIDIFile(4, deinterleave=False)

  # 6. Configure tracks
  midi.addTrackName(CH_PIANO, 0, "Piano - Observer")
  midi.addTempo(CH_PIANO, 0, TEMPO)
  midi.addProgramChange(CH_PIANO, CH_PIANO, 0, PROG_PIANO)

  # 7. Add notes with: addNote(track, channel, pitch, time, duration, velocity)
  midi.addNote(CH_PIANO, CH_PIANO, D4, time=0, duration=1, velocity=80)

  # 8. Write file
  with open(output_path, "wb") as f:
      midi.writeFile(f)

  description: |
    MIDI note numbers 0-127 span from C-1 (8.18 Hz) to G9 (12543.85 Hz).
    A4 = note 69 = 440 Hz is the standard reference pitch.

  formula:
    note_to_freq: "f = 440 × 2^((n - 69) / 12)"
    freq_to_note: "n = 69 + 12 × log2(f / 440)"

  reference_points:
    C_minus1: { note: 0, freq: 8.18 }
    C0: { note: 12, freq: 16.35 }
