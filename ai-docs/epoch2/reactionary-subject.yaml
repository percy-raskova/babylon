# Slice 2.3: The Reactionary Subject

# ==============================================================================
#
# POSITIONING RATIONALE:
# This slice is placed early in Epoch 2 because it answers the foundational
# question: WHO are the player's potential allies vs. enemies?
#
# You cannot make meaningful strategic decisions about:
# - Resource Economy (2.5) - who you organize determines resources
# - Kinetic Warfare (2.6) - who fights for you depends on class
# - Doctrine Tree (2.7) - ideological choices depend on class composition
#
# ...without first understanding the CLASS BASIS of both revolution AND fascism.
#
# The Reactionary Subject defines:
# 1. Which classes form the revolutionary base (P_w, L_u)
# 2. Which classes form the fascist base (C_pb, C_la)
# 3. The organizational traps of recruiting from the wrong class
# 4. The Lumpen distinction (George Jackson model)

# CORE THESIS
# ==============================================================================

thesis:
  statement: |
    Fascism is not a random evil or a psychological aberration. It is the DEFENSIVE
    FORM of capitalism, emerging when the ruling class can no longer rule in the old
    way and requires a mass base to crush the revolutionary movement.

    That mass base comes from specific class positions:
    - The PETTY BOURGEOISIE (C_pb): Small capitalists squeezed by monopoly capital
    - The LABOR ARISTOCRACY (C_la): Workers bribed by imperial spoils

    These classes share "STATUS ANXIETY" - they have something to LOSE. When crisis
    hits, their agitation routes to fascism (protection of privilege) rather than
    revolution (abolition of class).

    The LUMPENPROLETARIAT (L_u), despite their volatility, NEVER form the fascist
    base because they have ZERO investment in the system. The police are their
    natural enemy. They may disintegrate into chaos, but they do not join the
    fascist side.

  liberal_trap: |
    Liberalism misunderstands fascism as "hatred" or "irrationality." This leads to:
    - Appeals to reason (which cannot address material interests)
    - Alliances with the "reasonable right" (who fund fascism)
    - Neglect of the class basis (which continues to produce fascists)

    The game teaches: You cannot defeat fascism by persuasion. You defeat it by
    changing the material conditions that produce it, and by building solidarity
    infrastructure BEFORE the crisis hits.

      "The lumpen are the most dangerous class in the struggle, because they have
      the least to lose. They have no stake in the system. This makes them volatile
      but also makes them the most reliable revolutionaries when properly organized.
      The police are their natural enemy - there is no path to fascism for them."

      - "SWING_CLASS: Routes to fascism OR reaction based on solidarity presence"
    squeeze_dynamic: |
      The petty bourgeoisie is squeezed from BOTH directions:
      - FROM ABOVE: Monopoly capital (C_b) drives them out of business
      - FROM BELOW: Organized workers (P_w) threaten their small privilege

      This squeeze produces intense AGITATION but without class consciousness.
      Their rage seeks a target that preserves capitalism: immigrants, minorities,
      communists - anyone except the actual source of their decline.

  labor_aristocracy:

      - "DEFECTION_RISK: May defect to fascism during CRISIS event"
      - "RESOURCE_RICH: Brings money and infrastructure to organization"
    trap_mechanism: |
      The Labor Aristocracy is the ORGANIZATIONAL TRAP of the revolutionary movement.

      They are attractive recruits because:
      - They have money (union dues, stable income)
      - They have legitimacy (respectable, organized)
      - They have infrastructure (union halls, media)

      But they carry CHAUVINISM: investment in imperial privilege that manifests as:
      - Opposition to immigrant workers
      - Support for imperialist foreign policy
      - Prioritization of "domestic" issues over international solidarity

      During a CRISIS, if Chauvinism > Discipline, they DEFECT to the fascist faction,
      taking their resources with them.

# FASCIST RECRUITMENT ENGINE

fascist_recruitment:
  name: "The Fascist Pull"
  description: |
    The Fascist faction is not player-controlled but emerges from class dynamics.
    It recruits from C_pb and C_la when conditions are right.

  target_classes:
    - C_pb  # Petty Bourgeoisie (small business)
    - C_la  # Labor Aristocracy (super-wage workers)

  never_recruits:
    - L_u  # Lumpenproletariat (police are enemy)
    - P_w  # Proletariat (can be atomized but not fascistized)

  trigger_conditions:
    agitation: ">= 0.6"  # High discontent
    entitlement: ">= 0.5"  # Investment in status quo
    solidarity: "< 0.3"  # Low solidarity infrastructure

  recruitment_formula: |
    Fascist_Pull = Agitation × (Entitlement / (Solidarity + 0.1))

    If Fascist_Pull > 1.0:
      - Target node begins FASCIST_DRIFT
      - +0.05 fascist_alignment per tick
      - At fascist_alignment >= 1.0: Node joins Fascist faction

  blocking_solidarity: |
    Solidarity infrastructure BLOCKS fascist recruitment.
    If Solidarity >= 0.5:
      - Fascist_Pull is halved
      - Agitation routes to class consciousness instead

    This is why solidarity must be built BEFORE crisis:
    "Agitation without solidarity produces fascism, not revolution."

    failure_mode: "Premature action triggers SPONTANEOUS_RIOT"

  police_enemy_trait: |
    The Lumpenproletariat are STRUCTURALLY incapable of fascism.
    The police are their natural enemy - not ideologically, but materially.
    They are criminalized, surveilled, incarcerated.

    This means:
    - They never defect to fascist faction (unlike C_la)
    - They may disintegrate (atomization) but not join the enemy
    - With proper organization, this makes them the MOST RELIABLE revolutionary force

      Class determines State targeting:
      - C_la organizing draws less attention (legitimate)
      - L_u organizing draws maximum attention (criminalized)
      - P_w organizing draws moderate attention
      The Reactionary Subject defines WHO is organized; State Attention defines
      HOW the State responds.

  cohesion_mechanic:
    slice: "2.2b"
    connection: |
      Class diversity affects organizational Cohesion:
      - Homogeneous class base → higher baseline Cohesion
      - C_la + L_u mix → high Entropy (conflicting interests)
      - C_pb in organization → Entitlement infection spreads
      The Reactionary Subject defines WHO is in organization; Cohesion defines
      HOW well they work together.
