# KEY FINDING 1: The Labor Aristocracy is Geographically Concentrated
#==============================================================================
labor_aristocracy_metros:
  description: |
    Metros with highest median incomes represent the geographic concentration
    of the labor aristocracy - workers whose wages exceed the value they produce
    due to imperial rent extraction. These are the "bomb factory" towns where
    workers have the highest material stake in system preservation.

  top_20:
    - metro: "San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA"
      median_income: 138370

      income_to_rent_ratio: 6.03
      notes: "Most favorable income-to-rent ratio among top metros"

  game_implication: |
    These metros should have highest super_wage_rate values and strongest
    fascist_bifurcation tendencies when crisis hits. Workers here have the
    most to lose from system collapse - they will defend imperialism.

# KEY FINDING 2: Rent Burden WITHOUT Solidarity = Fascism Fuel (NOT Revolution)
#==============================================================================
rent_burden_crisis:
  description: |
    CRITICAL MLM-TW CORRECTION: High rent burden does NOT automatically create
    revolutionary potential. The fascist bifurcation formula is explicit:
    "Agitation without solidarity produces fascism, not revolution."

    Rent burden in atomized populations (college towns, transient workers)
    produces: DSA membership, Bernie votes, lifestyle leftism, and when
    crisis intensifies - scapegoating and reaction. NOT revolutionary
    organization.

  severe_burden_leaders:  # 50%+ of income on rent
    - metro: "Ithaca, NY"
      pct_severe_burden: 37.9
      median_income: 64260
      mlm_tw_analysis: |
        COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY despite rent burden. Students are aspirational
        labor aristocracy - they FORESEE survival within the system. P(S|A)
        is high because they expect professional-managerial integration.
        Transience = no organic community bonds = atomization.
    - metro: "Vineland-Bridgeton, NJ"
      pct_severe_burden: 37.3
      median_income: 58397
      mlm_tw_analysis: |
        POTENTIAL revolutionary base - agricultural workers with stable
        residence, non-aspirational class position. But requires solidarity
        infrastructure assessment.

      mlm_tw_analysis: |
        COMPLEX - large Latino working class with non-transient roots vs.
        service workers for tourism. Requires local solidarity assessment.
        Cuban exile community creates counter-revolutionary bloc.
    - metro: "New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA"
      pct_severe_burden: 27.5
      median_income: 86445
      mlm_tw_analysis: |
        VELVET GLOVE LIBERALISM - gripped by reformist ideology. High rent
        burden produces DSA chapters and tenant organizing that explicitly
        rejects revolutionary politics. Manhattan is particularly counter-
        revolutionary despite material conditions. The "non-profit industrial
        complex" channels grievance into system-preserving reformism.

  pattern_analysis: |
    College towns dominate rent burden metrics because:
    1. Student populations are TRANSIENT = high atomization
    2. Students FORESEE professional-managerial class integration
    3. No organic community bonds to transmit class consciousness
    4. Exception: Palestinian solidarity (2024 encampments) shows that
       SPECIFIC international solidarity CAN briefly penetrate the bubble

    THE KEY INSIGHT: Rent burden is AGITATION ENERGY. Where it routes
    depends entirely on SOLIDARITY INFRASTRUCTURE presence:
    - WITH solidarity → class consciousness
    - WITHOUT solidarity → national identity / reaction

  game_implication: |
    Rent burden should increase AGITATION_ENERGY, not revolutionary potential.
    The routing depends on solidarity_edge presence:

    if solidarity_strength > 0:
        consciousness_drift += agitation_energy * k
    else:
        ideology_drift_toward_nationalism += agitation_energy * k

    College towns should have NEGATIVE solidarity_baseline due to transience.
    This makes them fascism-prone despite high agitation.

#==============================================================================
# KEY FINDING 3: The Contradiction - High Income ≠ Material Security
#==============================================================================
contradiction_metros:
  description: |
    Some high-income metros STILL have severe housing burden. This is the
    "California Contradiction" - nominal wages high but real purchasing power
    eroded. These workers are labor aristocracy by income but proletariat by
    material conditions. This creates revolutionary potential in unexpected places.

  top_cases:
    - metro: "Boulder, CO"
      median_income: 92466
      pct_50plus_burden: 31.7
      analysis: "Tech workers facing housing crisis"
    - metro: "Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA"

      analysis: "Finance workers - high nominal income, high costs"
    - metro: "New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA"
      median_income: 86445
      pct_50plus_burden: 27.5
      analysis: "Largest absolute population with severe burden"

  game_implication: |
    Create a "real_wage_ratio" mechanic: nominal_income / housing_cost
    Workers with high nominal income but low real_wage_ratio should have
    HIGHER consciousness_drift sensitivity than low-income workers who
    never expected prosperity. The "betrayed middle class" is historically
    key to both fascism AND revolution.

#==============================================================================
# KEY FINDING 4: Government Worker Concentration = State Dependency
#==============================================================================
government_worker_metros:
  description: |
    CRITICAL MLM-TW INSIGHT: Military and federal installations are THE
    dominant factor determining counter-revolutionary stability. This
    overwhelms other economic factors (including rent burden).

    Military towns with adjacent universities are NOT "contradiction zones"
    - the military/federal influence far outweighs student population effects.
    From firsthand experience: organizing is effectively impossible in these
    environments because the majority population has DIRECT material stake
    in imperial apparatus continuation.

        Fort Riley (1st Infantry Division) + Kansas State University.
        CRITICAL CORRECTION: Military influence DOMINATES despite student
        population. The university serves as military feeder institution.
        Counter-revolutionary stronghold despite high renter %.

      pct_govt: 11.0
      mlm_tw_analysis: |
        Fort Huachuca - US Army Intelligence Center. NSA/CIA contractor
        presence. Maximum state integration. Organizing target for
        COINTELPRO observation, not revolutionary work.

      pct_govt: 11.0
      mlm_tw_analysis: |
        Naval Base Kitsap - nuclear submarine base. Pacific Fleet logistics.

    - metro: "Hinesville, GA"
      pct_govt: 9.8
      mlm_tw_analysis: |
        Fort Stewart - 3rd Infantry Division. Majority population is military
        or military-dependent. Local economy entirely parasitic on base.
        Revolutionary work here is suicide.

  pattern_analysis: |
    MILITARY TOWNS are THE primary counter-revolutionary formations:
    1. Direct material stake in imperial apparatus
    2. Self-selection for ideological conformity (clearances)
    3. Concentrated state violence capacity (QRF always available)
    4. Cultural hegemony of military values in surrounding community
    5. Adjacent universities become MILITARY FEEDERS, not opposition

    University towns adjacent to bases are NOT contradiction zones -
    the military influence is hegemonic.

  game_implication: |
    MILITARY_PRESENCE should be the DOMINANT territory modifier:
    - Sets consciousness_ceiling (cannot exceed 0.3 even with crisis)
    - Reduces solidarity_edge formation by 80%
    - Increases COINTELPRO effectiveness by 200%
    - Provides instant QRF deployment (zero response time)
    - Creates "informant culture" multiplier on organization exposure

    State capitals have weaker but still significant effect.
    University employment alone (without military) has minimal effect.

#==============================================================================
# KEY FINDING 5: Atomization Index - Renters vs Owners
#==============================================================================
atomization_patterns:
  description: |
    Renter concentration is a proxy for atomization - renters are more mobile,
    have less stake in local property values, and are more easily organized
    (or more easily displaced). High renter % = potential organizing base
    but also potential fascist mob base if no solidarity infrastructure.

  game_implication: |
    Use renter_ratio to modify:
    - Organization capacity (high renter = easier to organize but also disperse)
    - Heat decay rate (renters leave when evicted, owners stay and fight)
    - Fascist mob formation (rootless renters can be mobilized for violence)
    - Gentrification displacement mechanics

  game_implication: |
    Production worker concentration should affect:
    - Strike effectiveness (concentrated workplaces = higher impact)
    - Base organization stat (union traditions)
    - Vulnerability to automation narrative (fascist scapegoating)
    - Consciousness routing (class identity vs national identity)

#==============================================================================
income_inequality:
  description: |
    Top-to-bottom income ratio (households earning $100k+ vs under $25k)
    reveals class stratification within metros. High ratios = stark inequality
    (visible mansions next to poverty). Low ratios = uniform poverty.

  puerto_rico_special_case:
    note: |
      Puerto Rico metros have ratios of 0.02-0.13 because almost everyone
      is poor. This is colonial extraction - the "equality of poverty."

      - metro: "Mayagüez, PR"
        top_bottom_ratio: 0.06
        median_income: 16456

  game_implication: |
    High inequality should:
    - Increase agitation generation (visible injustice)
    - Enable fascist scapegoating (someone to blame)
    - Require solidarity_edges for revolutionary routing

    Low inequality (uniform poverty) should:
    - Reduce internal class divisions
    - Enable faster consciousness development
    - Make revolutionary organization easier (no labor aristocracy buffer)

#==============================================================================
# KEY FINDING 8: Colonial Extraction - Puerto Rico
#==============================================================================
puerto_rico_analysis:
  description: |
    Puerto Rico metros consistently show the clearest colonial patterns:
    highest unemployment, lowest incomes, highest rent burden, lowest inequality
    (everyone poor). This is imperial rent extraction in its purest form.

    - PR average unemployment: 15-22%
    - US median income: ~$70,000
    - PR median income: ~$17,000-$25,000

  game_implication: |
    Puerto Rico should be modeled as INTERNAL PERIPHERY:
    - Zero or negative imperial rent receipt
    - Maximum extraction_rate from mainland
    - Territory type: COLONIAL_POSSESSION
    - High revolutionary_potential but LOW organization capacity (colonial suppression)

# COMPOSITE INDEX 1: Revolutionary Potential Score (CORRECTED MLM-TW FORMULA)
#==============================================================================
revolutionary_potential_index:
  description: |
    CRITICAL REVISION: The original formula was FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED because
    it treated rent burden and renter % as positive indicators of revolutionary
    potential. This is ORTHODOX MARXIST ECONOMISM, not MLM-TW analysis.

    The corrected formula must account for:
    1. ATOMIZATION (transience, lack of organic community) as NEGATIVE
    2. MILITARY/FEDERAL PRESENCE as DOMINANT NEGATIVE
    3. ASPIRATIONAL CLASS POSITION (students) as NEGATIVE
    4. EXISTING SOLIDARITY INFRASTRUCTURE as PREREQUISITE

    Census data CANNOT directly measure solidarity infrastructure - this is
    a limitation of quantitative analysis. Revolutionary potential requires
    LOCAL ASSESSMENT of organizing history, union presence, mutual aid networks.

  flawed_original_formula: |
    # DO NOT USE - preserved for documentation of error
    RPI = (pct_severe_rent_burden × 0.30) +

    # Atomization Factor (REDUCES routing to class consciousness)
    AF = transience_proxy × 0.5   # High renter in college town = atomized

    # Actual Revolutionary Potential requires NON-CENSUS data:

  puerto_rico_exception:
    note: |
      Puerto Rico metros DO have genuine revolutionary potential because:
      1. Colonial extraction = W_c/V_c ratio BELOW 1 (true periphery)
      2. Non-transient population with community roots
      3. Historical independence organizing tradition
      4. No labor aristocracy buffer (uniform poverty)

      Puerto Rico is INTERNAL PERIPHERY within US territory.

  key_insight: |
    Census data measures AGITATION ENERGY, not revolutionary potential.
    Agitation energy routes through the fascist bifurcation:

    WITH solidarity infrastructure → class consciousness
    WITHOUT solidarity infrastructure → national identity / reaction

    College towns have HIGH agitation but LOW solidarity (atomization).
    Military towns have NEGATIVE potential regardless of other factors.
    Genuine revolutionary potential exists in:
    - Stable working-class communities with organizing history
    - Agricultural labor with farmworker movement ties
    - Industrial proletariat with union traditions
    - Colonial territories (Puerto Rico) with independence history

  key_insight: |
    UTAH METROS appear repeatedly (Ogden, Provo, Salt Lake) because:
    1. High home ownership (LDS culture emphasizes property)
    2. Strong community ties (reduces atomization)
    3. Lower rent burden (less speculation than coastal cities)
    4. Conservative ideology (national identity routing guaranteed)

    These are FASCIST STRONGHOLD candidates in crisis scenarios.

# GAME DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS (CORRECTED MLM-TW FRAMEWORK)

game_design_recommendations:

  territory_initialization:
    description: |
      Use census data to initialize territory attributes. CRITICAL: Census data
      measures AGITATION ENERGY and COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY FACTORS. It CANNOT
      measure solidarity infrastructure - that requires separate modeling.
    mappings:
      - census_field: median_income
        game_field: base_wage
        transform: "median_income / 1000"
        notes: "Higher wage = more to lose = higher P(S|A)"
      - census_field: pct_severe_burden
        game_field: agitation_energy_baseline
        transform: "pct_severe_burden / 100"
        notes: "This is AGITATION, not revolutionary potential"
      - census_field: pct_renter
        game_field: atomization_factor
        transform: "pct_renter / 100 IF college_town ELSE pct_renter / 200"
        notes: "College town renters = atomized, industrial renters = potential"
      - census_field: pct_production
        game_field: industrial_proletariat_base
        transform: "pct_production / 10"
        notes: "Concentrated workplace = strike potential"
      - census_field: pct_federal_military
        game_field: imperial_apparatus_integration
        transform: "pct_federal_military × 3.0"
        notes: "DOMINANT factor - overrides other considerations"
      - census_field: pct_retirement_age
        game_field: no_future_horizon_factor
        transform: "pct_retirement_age / 100"
        notes: "No stake in future = counter-revolutionary"

  consciousness_dynamics:
    - rule: "High inequality (>4.0 ratio) increases AGITATION_GENERATION by 50%"
      note: "Not consciousness - agitation routes through bifurcation"
    - rule: "High rent burden (>30%) increases AGITATION_ENERGY by 25%"
      note: "Corrected from 'consciousness_drift' - energy must route through solidarity"
    - rule: "High military/federal (>5%) sets consciousness_ceiling at 0.3"
      note: "DOMINANT - cannot organize in occupied territory"
    - rule: "High production workers (>12%) provides +20% solidarity_edge_formation_potential"
      note: "Potential only realized with organizer presence"
    - rule: "College town modifier: solidarity_baseline = -0.3"
      note: "Transience destroys organic bonds"

  fascist_bifurcation_modifiers:
    - condition: "agitation_energy > 50 AND solidarity_infrastructure < 0.2"
      effect: "national_identity routing probability = 80%"
      note: "The core MLM-TW insight: crisis without solidarity = fascism"
    - condition: "military_federal_pct > 8%"
      effect: "consciousness_routing_blocked = true"
      note: "Cannot organize in imperial apparatus territory"
    - condition: "college_town = true AND rent_burden > 30%"
      effect: "DSA_membership_increase but revolutionary_potential = 0"
      note: "Velvet glove liberalism captures grievance"
    - condition: "pct_owner > 75 AND median_age > 55"
      effect: "counter_revolutionary_mobilization_ready = true"
      note: "Property + no future = defend system at all costs"

  strategic_value:
    genuine_organizing_targets:
      - pattern: "Agricultural proletariat + Latino community + UFW history"
        examples: ["El Centro CA", "Vineland-Bridgeton NJ", "Brownsville TX"]
        reason: "Stable population, non-aspirational, organizing traditions, organic bonds"
      - pattern: "Industrial proletariat + Union history + Midwest"
        examples: ["Dalton GA", "Elkhart IN", "Sheboygan WI"]
        reason: "Concentrated workplace, production workers, potential strike leverage"
      - pattern: "Colonial territory with independence tradition"
        examples: ["Mayagüez PR", "San Juan PR", "Ponce PR"]
        reason: "True periphery - W_c/V_c < 1, no labor aristocracy buffer"

    INCORRECTLY_targeted_in_original_analysis:
      - pattern: "College town + High rent burden"
        examples: ["Gainesville FL", "Athens GA", "Ithaca NY", "Bloomington IN"]
        correction: |
          These are COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY despite material conditions:
          1. Aspirational labor aristocracy (students expect PMC integration)
          2. Transience destroys organic community bonds
          3. Liberal reformism captures grievance (velvet glove)
          4. Service workers atomized, serving student/professional class
      - pattern: "Military-adjacent college town"
        examples: ["Manhattan KS", "College Station TX", "Hinesville GA"]
        correction: |
          Military influence is HEGEMONIC. University becomes military feeder.
          Organizing here is suicide - maximum COINTELPRO exposure.

    avoid_completely:
      - pattern: "Military base + Any other factors"
        examples: ["Sierra Vista AZ", "Bremerton WA", "California-Lexington Park MD"]
        reason: "Imperial apparatus HQ - organizing = arrest/infiltration"
      - pattern: "Retirement community + High ownership"
        examples: ["The Villages FL", "Naples FL", "Barnstable MA"]
        reason: "Maximum counter-revolutionary mobilization - fascist base"
      - pattern: "Finance/tech hub + Liberal politics"
        examples: ["San Francisco CA", "Manhattan NY", "Seattle WA"]
        reason: "Velvet glove liberalism - captures all grievance into reformism"

# DATA QUALITY NOTES
#==============================================================================
data_quality:

  aian_variant_limitation: |
    The ACSDT5YAIAN2021 variant appears to contain identical values to the
    main variant in our loaded data. This may be because the data files
    contain POPGROUP columns that were not properly parsed to filter by
    race/ethnicity. Future work should investigate the raw CSV structure
    to properly extract AIAN-specific demographic data for settler
    colonialism analysis.

  census_data_age: |
    2017-2021 5-year estimates predate COVID-19 economic impacts and the
    2020s housing crisis acceleration. Real-time rent burden has likely
    increased significantly since this data was collected.

  puerto_rico_coverage: |
    Puerto Rico metros are included in the dataset, enabling colonial
    extraction analysis. However, Puerto Rico is NOT a U.S. state and
    has different legal/economic frameworks that should be considered
    when modeling.
