# CORE THESIS
# ==============================================================================

thesis:
  statement: |
    Traditional intelligence models treat information as a commodity to be
    gathered through technical means (scouts, satellites, signals). This is
    the BOURGEOIS model of intelligence - it assumes you can buy or steal
    knowledge without building relationships.

    The DIALECTICAL model recognizes that in political struggle, intelligence
    flows through SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. The masses are the sea in which the
    guerrilla swims. When the sea is friendly, it reveals everything - hidden
    paths, enemy movements, supply caches, informants. When the sea is hostile,
    it conceals, deceives, and reports you to the enemy.

    This creates a fundamental asymmetry:
    - The State can SEE everywhere (Panopticon) but cannot UNDERSTAND
    - The Revolution can UNDERSTAND but only where it has built relationships

    The player learns: Political work precedes military work.
    Mass line precedes action. The fish must be in water to swim.

  liberal_trap: |
    The liberal believes intelligence is neutral - just "gather information."
    This leads to:
    - Sending scouts into hostile territory (getting them killed/captured)
    - Trusting technical intelligence over human intelligence
    - Acting on information from people who hate you (walking into traps)
    - Believing you can operate without political preparation

    The game teaches: You cannot KNOW a territory until you WIN it politically.
    Intelligence is not gathered, it is EARNED through mass work.

# THE INTELLIGENCE FORMULA
# ==============================================================================

intelligence_formula:
  name: "Intel Confidence"
  symbol: "I_c"
  range: [0.0, 1.0]
  description: |
    Intel Confidence represents how accurately the player perceives a territory.
    At I_c = 1.0, the player sees the TRUE state of all attributes.
    At I_c = 0.0, the player sees nothing.
    At I_c < 0.2 (Desert condition), the player may see FALSIFIED data.

  formula: |
    I_c = B_o + (C_p × M_r)

    Where:
      B_o = Base Observation (always visible public information)
      C_p = Cadre Presence (0 or 1, or count for multiple cadre)
      M_r = Mass Receptivity (willingness of masses to share information)

  components:
    base_observation:
      symbol: "B_o"
      value: 0.1
      description: |
        Public information visible without any presence:
        - Territory type (Slums, Suburbs, Industrial)
        - Approximate population
        - Major infrastructure (visible buildings)
        - Official State presence (police stations, bases)

        This is what you could learn from a map or public records.
        You cannot hide that a factory exists, but you can hide
        what happens inside it.

    cadre_presence:
      symbol: "C_p"
      type: "Boolean or Integer"
      description: |
        Whether the organization has human assets in the territory.
        - 0: No presence (only Base_Observation available)
        - 1: Cadre present (can potentially gather intel)
        - N: Multiple Cadre (slight bonus, but diminishing returns)

        CRITICAL: Presence alone is NOT sufficient.
        A Cadre in hostile territory is like a fish on land -
        visible, vulnerable, and blind.

    mass_receptivity:
      symbol: "M_r"
      range: [0.0, 1.0]
      description: |
        The willingness of the local population to share information
        with the revolutionary organization. This is the KEY variable
        that traditional fog of war ignores.

        High receptivity = The masses are your eyes and ears
        Low receptivity = The masses are the enemy's eyes and ears

# ==============================================================================
# MASS RECEPTIVITY CALCULATION
# ==============================================================================

mass_receptivity:
  name: "Mass Receptivity"
  symbol: "M_r"
  range: [0.0, 1.0]
  description: |
    Mass Receptivity is a derived metric representing how willing the
    local population is to share information with the organization.
    It depends on three factors:
    1. Material conditions (do they have anything to lose?)
    2. Ideological alignment (do they identify with you?)
    3. Class composition (which class dominates this territory?)

  formula: |
    M_r = (1 - P(S|A)) × I_a × C_f

    Where:
      P(S|A) = Probability of Survival by Acquiescence (from Survival Calculus)
      I_a = Ideological Alignment (0.0 to 1.0)
      C_f = Class Factor (based on dominant class in territory)

  components:
    desperation_factor:
      formula: "(1 - P(S|A))"
      description: |
        When P(S|A) is low, the masses have nothing to lose.
        They gain nothing by acquiescing to the system.
        Therefore, they have nothing to lose by helping the revolution.

        When P(S|A) is high, the masses are comfortable.
        They have something to protect by staying quiet.
        They will hedge their bets or actively oppose you.

        This is the MATERIAL BASIS of intelligence:
        "Those with nothing to lose have nothing to hide."

    ideological_alignment:
      symbol: "I_a"
      range: [0.0, 1.0]
      description: |
        How closely the local population's consciousness aligns with
        the organization's ideology. Derived from:
        - Average class_consciousness in territory
        - Organization's reputation in territory
        - Historical actions (did you help or harm them?)

        Even desperate people won't help an organization they hate.
        Even comfortable people might help an organization they love.

    class_factor:
      symbol: "C_f"
      description: |
        The class composition of the territory affects baseline receptivity.
        Different classes have different structural relationships to
        revolutionary organizations.

      values:
        proletariat:
          symbol: "P_w"
          factor: 1.0
          description: |
            The exploited working class has no structural reason to
            protect the system. If ideologically aligned and desperate,
            they become the revolutionary organization's eyes and ears.

        lumpenproletariat:
          symbol: "L_u"
          factor: 1.0
          description: |
            The surplus population has zero investment in the system.
            Police are their natural enemy. If organized, they are the
            most reliable intelligence source because they have the
            most to gain and least to lose.

        petty_bourgeoisie:
          symbol: "C_pb"
          factor: 0.3
          description: |
            Small property owners hedge their bets. They might help
            if they think you'll win, but they'll also help the State
            if they think you'll lose. Their information is unreliable
            and their loyalty is conditional.

        labor_aristocracy:
          symbol: "C_la"
          factor: 0.2
          description: |
            The labor aristocracy is structurally invested in the
            imperial order. They have super-wages to protect. They
            will actively inform on the organization to protect their
            privilege. In C_la territory, Cadre are in DANGER.

  examples:
    proletarian_slum:
      territory: "P_w dominated, high exploitation, low wages"
      P_S_A: 0.2  # Low - acquiescence doesn't help survival
      I_a: 0.7   # Moderate - some revolutionary consciousness
      C_f: 1.0   # Proletariat
      M_r: "(1 - 0.2) × 0.7 × 1.0 = 0.56"  # Mud/Contested
      description: "Receptive but not fully trusted yet"

    labor_aristocracy_suburb:
      territory: "C_la dominated, high wages, comfortable"
      P_S_A: 0.9  # High - acquiescence works for them
      I_a: 0.3   # Low - invested in system

# ==============================================================================
# THE THREE STATES OF VISION
# ==============================================================================

vision_states:
  description: |
    Based on Mass Receptivity, territories fall into three states that
    determine what the player can see and trust.

  desert:
    name: "The Desert"
    threshold: "M_r < 0.2"
    intel_confidence: "~0.15-0.25"
    description: |
      The fish is out of water. The Cadre is surrounded by people who
      will not help them and may actively work against them.

    visibility:
      public_info: true  # Base observation always works
      population: true
      territory_type: true
      state_presence: "Visible"
      agitation: "MASKED"  # May show false value
      organization_strength: "MASKED"
      hidden_threats: "INVISIBLE"
      supply_caches: "INVISIBLE"
      informants: "INVISIBLE"

    mechanics:
      masking: |
        In Desert conditions, some attributes are not just unknown -
        they are FALSIFIED. The UI shows a plausible but FALSE value.

        The player cannot tell which values are masked without higher
        receptivity. This creates the "ambush trap" where you think
        a territory is calm when it's actually mobilizing against you.

        Masked attributes:
        - Agitation: May show low when actually high
        - Enemy strength: May show low when preparing ambush
        - Allegiance: May show neutral when actively hostile

      cadre_risk: |
        Cadre in Desert territories face:
        - High probability of being reported (Security_Breach)
        - Rapid State Attention accumulation (+0.2/tick)
        - Risk of capture if Security_Breach triggers
        - Network exposure if captured

      decay_rate: 0.2  # Per tick - intel becomes stale very fast

    narrative_example: |
      "Your operative in the suburb reports calm. The lawns are mowed.
      The children play. The Neighborhood Watch meets on Tuesdays.
      What your operative cannot see: the WhatsApp group, the gun safe
      in every garage, the militia drilling in the church basement.
      The suburb smiles and waits for you to make a mistake."

  mud:
    name: "The Mud"
    threshold: "0.2 <= M_r < 0.8"
    intel_confidence: "~0.4-0.7"
    description: |
      The fish is in shallow water. Some of the masses help you,
      some are neutral, some are hostile. Information flows but
      incompletely. You know the general situation but miss details.

    visibility:
      public_info: true
      population: true
      territory_type: true
      state_presence: "Visible"
      agitation: "Approximate"  # ±0.2 margin of error
      organization_strength: "Approximate"
      hidden_threats: "PARTIALLY_VISIBLE"  # Larger threats visible
      supply_caches: "Some visible"
      informants: "INVISIBLE"  # Still hidden

    mechanics:
      approximation: |
        In Mud conditions, attributes are shown with uncertainty.
        The UI displays a range or a "~" prefix indicating the value
        is approximate.

        You know "tensions are rising" but not exactly how high.
        You know "there's some enemy presence" but not the exact count.

      cadre_risk: |
        Cadre in Mud territories face:
        - Moderate probability of being reported
        - State Attention accumulation (+0.1/tick)
        - Can operate but must be careful
        - Some mass protection but not complete

      decay_rate: 0.05  # Per tick - moderate decay

    narrative_example: |
      "The factory district is split. The older workers remember the
      last strike - some with pride, some with fear. Your contacts say
      tensions are rising, but they can't tell you about the new foreman
      who's been photographing union members. You know enough to act,
      but not enough to act safely."

  water:
    name: "The Water"
    threshold: "M_r >= 0.8"
    intel_confidence: "~0.9-1.0"
    description: |
      The fish is in deep water. The masses ARE your intelligence network.
      They tell you everything because they are you - the organization
      and the people are one.

    visibility:
      public_info: true
      population: true
      territory_type: true
      state_presence: "Visible (including plainclothes)"
      agitation: "EXACT"
      organization_strength: "EXACT"
      hidden_threats: "VISIBLE"
      supply_caches: "VISIBLE"
      informants: "VISIBLE"  # The masses know and tell you

    mechanics:
      full_transparency: |
        In Water conditions, you see the TRUE state of all attributes.
        The masses are your eyes. They report:
        - Every police patrol and its timing
        - Every informant and their handler
        - Every supply cache and safe house
        - Every faction's true strength and morale

      cadre_safety: |
        Cadre in Water territories are protected:
        - The masses hide them from State detection
        - State Attention accumulation is reduced (-0.05/tick)
        - Early warning of State operations
        - Network resilience (if one contact is captured,
          others continue to function)

      decay_rate: 0.01  # Per tick - masses keep you updated

    narrative_example: |
      "In the liberated zone, you know everything. The grandmother who
      watches the corner knows when the patrol changes shift. The children
      who play in the street know which houses are safe. The workers who
      unload the trucks know what supplies are coming. You are not a spy
      in their midst - you are their organization, and they are your eyes."

# ACTIONS: THE MASS LINE
# ==============================================================================

actions:
  description: |
    The critical insight: You cannot SCOUT your way to intelligence.
    You must WORK your way to intelligence. The Mass Line is not just
    ideology - it is the operational doctrine of revolutionary intelligence.

  agitate_locally:

    effects:
      ideological_alignment: "+0.05 per tick"
      state_attention: "+0.02 per tick (risky in hostile territory)"
    description: |
      The fundamental mass work action. Cadre engage with the local
      population, spreading revolutionary consciousness and building
      relationships.

      This is NOT propaganda distribution - it is two-way communication.
      The Cadre LEARN from the masses while teaching them.

      Effect on intel: Increases M_r indirectly by increasing I_a.
      You cannot shortcut this work. Political work precedes intelligence.

    failure_modes:
      desert_territory: |
        In Desert conditions, agitation is extremely dangerous.
        The Cadre are easily identified and reported.
        State Attention increases rapidly (+0.2/tick instead of +0.02).
        High probability of Security_Breach event.

        You should NOT agitate in hostile territory without first
        establishing a safe network through other means.

      hidden_attributes: "Reveals one hidden attribute"
    description: |
      Deep research into local conditions. The Cadre systematically
      interviews the masses, maps social relationships, and documents
      the local situation.

      This is Mao's "investigation" method - actually talking to people
      and recording what they say. Not surveillance, but conversation.

      Reveals:
      - Hidden reactionary cells
      - Informant networks
      - Supply cache locations
      - Local power dynamics (who really controls what)

    failure_modes:
      low_receptivity: |
        If M_r < 0.3, the action automatically fails.
        The masses will not talk to you. They may actively lie.
        Any "intel" gathered is potentially MASKED (false).

        Message: "The investigation fails. The people do not trust you.

    description: |
      Creates a permanent intelligence network in the territory.
      This is not a "spy network" - it is a relationship network.
      The masses WANT to help you because you are their organization.

      Once established, the network:
      - Provides continuous intel without Cadre presence
      - Warns of State operations before they happen
      - Hides Cadre when needed
      - Identifies threats and opportunities

    vulnerabilities:
      infiltration: |
        Contact networks can be infiltrated by State assets.
        If State Attention on territory exceeds 0.7:
        - 10% chance per tick of network compromise
        - Compromise leads to SECURITY_BREACH cascade
        - Network must be rebuilt from scratch

      decapitation: |
        If key contacts are captured, network degrades.
        Each captured contact: -0.1 M_r in territory
        If too many captured: Network collapses

      The Panopticon and Epistemic Horizon are COMPLEMENTARY systems:
      - Panopticon: How the STATE sees the PLAYER
      - Epistemic Horizon: How the PLAYER sees the WORLD

      The key interaction is FISH OUT OF WATER:
      - Cadre in hostile territory (low M_r) are easily detected
      - The masses actively REPORT them to the State
      - State Attention increases rapidly
      - This creates a feedback loop: hostile territory → exposure → capture

      Formula for State Attention from Fish Out of Water:
      ```
      ΔA_state = (1 - M_r) × Cadre_Presence × 0.2
      ```

      In friendly territory (high M_r), masses HIDE the Cadre:
      ```
      ΔA_state = max(0, (0.5 - M_r) × Cadre_Presence × 0.1)
      ```

  reactionary_subject:
    slice: "3.3"
    connection: |
      The Reactionary Subject defines CLASS COMPOSITION which determines
      the baseline Class Factor (C_f) for Mass Receptivity.

      Territory dominated by:
      - P_w (Proletariat): C_f = 1.0 - potential Base Area
      - L_u (Lumpenproletariat): C_f = 1.0 - potential Base Area
      - C_pb (Petty Bourgeoisie): C_f = 0.3 - difficult terrain
      - C_la (Labor Aristocracy): C_f = 0.2 - hostile terrain

      This means you cannot build intelligence networks in C_la suburbs
      without FIRST changing the class character of the territory
      (which may not be possible).

  kinetic_warfare:
    slice: "3.7"
    connection: |
      Intel Confidence directly affects combat outcomes.

      Attack with high confidence (Water):
      - Know enemy positions
      - Know escape routes
      - Know which buildings are safe
      - Surprise multiplier active

      Attack with low confidence (Desert):
      - Enemy positions unknown
      - May walk into ambush
      - No escape route intel
      - Enemy gets surprise multiplier

      The lesson: Do political work BEFORE military work.
      Win the terrain before you fight on it.

  resource_economy:
    slice: "3.6"
    connection: |
      Intelligence work requires Cadre Labor:
      - Agitation: 5 CL per tick
      - Social Investigation: 10 CL (3 ticks)
      - Contact Network: 20 CL (5 ticks)

      This creates a resource trade-off:
      - Cadre spent on intel can't do other work
      - But operations without intel are disasters
      - Balance: Invest in intel for territories you plan to operate in

intelligence_decay:
  description: |
    Intelligence is perishable. The situation changes, and if no one
    tells you, your information becomes stale and wrong.

    Decay rate depends on Mass Receptivity:
    - High M_r: Masses keep you updated (slow decay)
    - Low M_r: No one tells you anything (fast decay)

  formula: |
    I_c(t+1) = I_c(t) × (1 - decay_rate)

    Where decay_rate depends on M_r:
    - Water (M_r >= 0.8): decay_rate = 0.01
    - Mud (0.2 <= M_r < 0.8): decay_rate = 0.05
    - Desert (M_r < 0.2): decay_rate = 0.20

  implications:
    hostile_territory: |
      In hostile territory, intel decays by 20% per tick.
      After 5 ticks, intel is essentially worthless.
      After 10 ticks, it may be actively WRONG (stale masked data).

      You cannot "scout once and know forever."
      You must maintain presence AND receptivity.

    friendly_territory: |
      In friendly territory, intel decays by only 1% per tick.
      The masses keep you updated continuously.
      Even if Cadre leave temporarily, intel remains fresh.

      This is the advantage of Base Areas:
      Not just safety, but KNOWLEDGE.

# THE SPY SCENARIO: THE AMBUSH TRAP
# ==============================================================================

spy_scenario:
  name: "The Suburban Ambush"
  description: |
    A scenario demonstrating the danger of trusting intel from hostile territory.

  setup:
    territory: "Maple Heights Subdivision"
    class_composition: "C_la dominant (Labor Aristocracy suburb)"
    recent_events: "ECONOMIC_CRISIS has caused layoffs at defense contractor"
    true_state:
      agitation: 0.9  # Very high - fascist mobilization underway
      fascist_militia: 50  # Organized, armed, drilling
      informant_network: "Active - reporting all suspicious activity"
      sentiment: "Scapegoating immigrants and 'communists' for layoffs"

  player_action:
    action: "Send Cadre to investigate"
    cadre_count: 1
    expected_outcome: "Assess local conditions for potential organizing"

  intelligence_calculation:
    P_S_A: 0.85  # High - they were comfortable until crisis
    I_a: 0.15   # Very low - identify with system, blame outsiders
    C_f: 0.2    # Labor Aristocracy
    M_r: "(1 - 0.85) × 0.15 × 0.2 = 0.0045"  # DESERT
    I_c: "0.1 + (1 × 0.0045) = 0.1045"  # Very low confidence

  what_player_sees:
    ui_display:
      territory_name: "Maple Heights Subdivision"
      territory_type: "Suburban Residential"
      population: "~5,000"
      agitation: "0.1"  # MASKED - shows calm
      organization: "None detected"  # MASKED - militia hidden
      state_presence: "Low"
      confidence_indicator: "None visible"  # The trap
    internal_note: |
      The UI shows "Agitation: 0.1" with no warning.
      The player has no way to know this is MASKED data.
      The locals are hiding their mobilization.

  player_decision:
    reasoning: |
      "The suburb looks calm. Low agitation, no organization detected.
      The crisis must not have affected them much. Let's plan a leaflet
      campaign to start building consciousness."
    action: "Plan leaflet distribution operation with 10 Cadre"

  operation:
    phase_1:
      action: "Cadre enter territory with leaflets"
      reality: |
        The moment the Cadre enter, the Neighborhood Watch activates.
        Every resident has the WhatsApp group. Within 5 minutes, the
        militia is mobilizing. Police are called. Escape routes are
        blocked by "concerned citizens."

    phase_2:
      action: "Cadre begin distributing leaflets"
      reality: |
        The residents don't argue or engage. They smile, nod, and
        immediately photograph the Cadre, their vehicle, their plates.
        Meanwhile, armed militia are taking positions.

    phase_3:
      action: "Cadre attempt to leave"
      event: "AMBUSH_SPRUNG"
      effects:
        - "3 Cadre captured by militia (handed to police)"
        - "2 Cadre injured in confrontation"
        - "Vehicle seized, plates traced to safe house"
        - "SECURITY_BREACH cascade begins"
        - "Network exposure: safe house compromised"

  aftermath:
    immediate:
      cadre_lost: 3
      cadre_injured: 2
      safe_house: "Compromised"
      state_attention: "+0.4 on organization"
    cascade:
      interrogation: "Captured Cadre may reveal other contacts"
      network_damage: "Safe house must be abandoned"
      reputation: "-0.2 in region (operation failed publicly)"

  lesson: |
    "You planned your operation based on data that showed calm. But you
    were reading MASKED data from a hostile population. The suburb wasn't
    calm - it was mobilizing. The low agitation you saw was a lie the
    locals were happy to let you believe.

    The fish was out of water. It could not see the sharks circling.

    Before operating in hostile territory, you must first do the political
    work to change the territory - or accept that you are operating blind
    and plan accordingly."

# ==============================================================================
# UI REPRESENTATION
# ==============================================================================

ui_representation:
  description: |
    The UI must communicate uncertainty without making the player paranoid
    about every piece of data. The goal is to teach the PATTERN:
    friendly territory = trustworthy data, hostile territory = suspect data.

  confidence_indicators:
    high_confidence:
      threshold: "I_c >= 0.8"
      display: "Solid white text"
      example: "Agitation: 0.7"

    moderate_confidence:
      threshold: "0.4 <= I_c < 0.8"
      display: "Text with ~ prefix, slightly faded"
      example: "Agitation: ~0.5"

    low_confidence:
      threshold: "0.2 <= I_c < 0.4"
      display: "Text with ? suffix, faded"
      example: "Agitation: 0.3?"

    masked_data:
      threshold: "I_c < 0.2"
      display: "APPEARS NORMAL - the trap"
      example: "Agitation: 0.1"
      note: |
        This is the critical design decision. Masked data looks NORMAL.
        The player must learn to distrust data from hostile territories
        not because the UI warns them, but because they've been burned.

        After experiencing the Ambush Scenario, players will:
        1. Check M_r before trusting any data
        2. Do political work before military work
        3. Understand that hostile territory = blind territory
