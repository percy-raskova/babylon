# Imperial Circuit Model
# Expanded 4-node model for true MLM-TW dynamics
#
# Context: The 2-node model (worker → owner) is "orthodox book-worship Marxism"
# It fails to capture WHY core workers support imperialism: they benefit from it.
# "Happy to work at the bomb factory because it pays well."

  version: "1.0.0"
  created: "2025-12-09"
  purpose: "Define the minimum viable model for imperial dynamics"
  problem_statement: |
    Current 2-node model has single dynamic: exploitation → consciousness → revolution.
    This is LINEAR and BORING because it ignores:
    - Global value chains (periphery → core)
    - Super-wages (labor aristocracy)
    - False consciousness from material benefit
    - The reason revolution happens in periphery FIRST

# =============================================================================
# THE CURRENT (INSUFFICIENT) MODEL
# =============================================================================

current_model:
  nodes: 2
  structure:
    - name: "Periphery Worker (P_w)"
      role: PERIPHERY_PROLETARIAT
      description: "Exploited worker, produces value, receives subsistence"
    - name: "Core Owner (C_b)"
      role: CORE_BOURGEOISIE
      description: "Capital owner, extracts surplus"

  edges: 1
  edge_types:
    - EXPLOITATION: "P_w → C_b (value flows from worker to owner)"

  problem: |
    Workers correctly develop revolutionary consciousness because wages = 0.
    By tick 2-3, consciousness hits 1.0, rent drops to 0, simulation stalls.
    This is correct for PERIPHERY dynamics but wrong for CORE.

    Missing: The mechanism by which core workers are BRIBED into supporting imperialism.

# =============================================================================
# THE IMPERIAL CIRCUIT (MVP)
# =============================================================================

imperial_circuit:

  overview: |
    The imperial circuit captures the global flow of value:
    1. Periphery workers create value
    2. Comprador elites extract and transfer to core
    3. Core bourgeoisie receives imperial rent
    4. Core workers receive super-wages (bribery) from imperial rent

    This creates TWO DYNAMICS:
    - Periphery: consciousness rises (material basis for revolution)
    - Core: consciousness decays (material basis for false consciousness)

  nodes:
    minimum: 4
    structure:

          atomization: "Low baseline (strong community ties)"
        dynamics: |
          W/V ratio < 1 → consciousness rises
          High consciousness + organization → revolution potential

          High atomization → hard to organize even if conscious
          High national_identity → loyalty to empire over class

# KEY FORMULAS
# =============================================================================

formulas:

  consciousness_drift:
    current: "dΨ/dt = k(1 - W/V) - λΨ"
    problem: "W always 0 (no WAGES edge exists)"
    fix: "Read W from incoming WAGES edges"
    dynamics:
      when_W_lt_V: "drift positive → revolutionary consciousness"
      when_W_gt_V: "drift negative → false consciousness"
      when_W_eq_V: "unstable equilibrium → crisis potential"

  imperial_rent_pool:
    definition: "Net flow available for super-wage bribery"
    formula: "Pool = Σ(TRIBUTE) - Σ(WAGES) - Σ(REPRESSION_COSTS)"
    dynamics:
      shrinking_pool: "Must cut super-wages → core consciousness rises"
      growing_pool: "Can increase super-wages → core consciousness falls"

  false_consciousness:
    mechanisms:
      material: "W > V breeds satisfaction with system"
      ideological: "nationalism competes with class identity"
      atomization: "consumer culture fragments solidarity"
    formula: |
      effective_consciousness = class_consciousness × (1 - national_identity) × (1 - atomization)

  revolution_threshold:
    current: "P(S|R) > P(S|A)"
    expanded: "P(S|R) > P(S|A) AND organization > atomization × repression"
    insight: "Consciousness alone insufficient - need organization against atomization"

# =============================================================================
# MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS
# =============================================================================

consciousness_model:

  current_problem: |
    Single dimension: ideology [-1, +1]
    Maps to consciousness [0, 1]
    Can only go up or down

  expanded_model:
    dimensions:
      class_consciousness:
        range: [0, 1]
        meaning: "Awareness of class position and exploitation"
        driver: "W/V ratio - material conditions"

      national_identity:
        range: [0, 1]
        meaning: "'American worker' vs 'worker who happens to be American'"
        driver: "Ideological apparatus, crisis scapegoating"
        competes_with: class_consciousness

      atomization:
        range: [0, 1]
        meaning: "Social fragmentation, individualism"
        driver: "Consumer culture, media, gig economy"
        effect: "Blocks organization regardless of consciousness"

    interactions: |
      - High class_consciousness + low national_identity = revolutionary
      - High class_consciousness + high national_identity = fascist potential
      - High anything + high atomization = impotent (can't organize)
      - Crisis reduces atomization temporarily (people seek community)

# =============================================================================
# GAME DYNAMICS (What Makes It Interesting)
# =============================================================================

game_dynamics:

  the_core_tension: |
    The imperial rent pool is FINITE.
    Periphery consciousness rises → resistance → extraction harder.
    Extraction costs rise → pool shrinks → hard choices.

  bourgeoisie_choices:
    option_1: "Maintain super-wages (keep core docile, shrink pool faster)"
    option_2: "Increase extraction (more repression in periphery)"
    option_3: "Austerity in core (risk core awakening)"
    option_4: "Fascism (redirect core anger at immigrants/foreigners)"

  falling_rate_of_bribery: |
    Structural tendency: harder to maintain labor aristocracy over time.
    Periphery resistance increases.
    Extraction costs rise.
    Eventually can't pay super-wages.
    Then: race between class consciousness and national chauvinism.

  crisis_as_phase_transition: |
    When super-wages drop:
    - Atomization cracks (people seek solidarity)
    - Class consciousness can rise
    - BUT national identity can also spike (scapegoating)
    - Fascism vs socialism as competing resolutions

  the_solidarity_question: |
    Can C_w and P_w build solidarity?
    This is the game's central choice.
    Material interests differ (C_w benefits from imperialism).
    But long-term: imperial rent pool will shrink.
    Strategic choice: build solidarity before crisis or be divided and conquered.
