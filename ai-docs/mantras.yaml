# CORE MANTRAS
# =============================================================================

mantras:

  graph_plus_math:
    text: "Graph + Math = History"
    meaning: |
      The simulation is fundamentally two things:
      1. A graph structure (NetworkX) capturing relationships
      2. Mathematical formulas determining state changes
      Everything else is presentation. History emerges from these deterministic rules.
    applies_to:
      - "Engine architecture decisions"
      - "Feature prioritization"
      - "Debugging simulation behavior"

  state_is_data:
    text: "State is pure data. Engine is pure transformation. They never mix."
    meaning: |
      WorldState contains only data (Pydantic models).
      Engine contains only functions that transform state.
      No business logic in data classes. No state in engine classes.
    applies_to:
      - "Model design"
      - "System implementation"
      - "Testing strategy"

  agitation_without_solidarity:
    text: "Agitation without solidarity produces fascism, not revolution."
    meaning: |
      Economic crisis creates "agitation energy" with no inherent direction.
      Without pre-existing solidarity infrastructure (unions, internationals),
      that energy flows toward scapegoating and fascism.
      This is why accelerationism fails historically.
    applies_to:
      - "Bifurcation formula design"
      - "Player strategy guidance"
      - "Historical scenario validation"
    reference: "ADR016_fascist_bifurcation"

  ai_observes_never_controls:
    text: "AI observes, never controls."
    meaning: |
      The AI (LLM) generates narrative from state changes.
      It never determines mechanical outcomes.
      This ensures reproducibility and testability.
    applies_to:
      - "NarrativeDirector design"
      - "RAG integration"
      - "Testing AI features"
    reference: "ADR003_ai_as_observer"

# =============================================================================
# TOOLING MANTRAS
# =============================================================================

  documentation_reveals_structure:
    text: "Good documentation highlights possible structural issues."
    meaning: |
      When documentation tools (like Sphinx) produce warnings about duplicates,
      cross-reference conflicts, or organizational problems, treat these as
      signals worth investigating. They may reveal deeper architectural issues.

      However, warnings require DIAGNOSIS, not automatic refactoring.
      The warning may indicate a tool configuration issue, not a code problem.
    applies_to:
      - "Sphinx documentation builds"
      - "Static analysis warnings"
      - "IDE hints and suggestions"
    added: "2025-12-11"
    context: "Discovered during Sphinx duplicate cross-reference investigation"

  codebase_is_truth:
    text: |
      Tools conform to the codebase as truth.
      We don't design the codebase to fit the tools.
    meaning: |
      When there's a conflict between how the codebase is structured and
      how a tool wants things organized:

      1. FIRST: Verify the codebase structure is intentional and correct
      2. IF CORRECT: Configure the tool to work with our structure
      3. NEVER: Warp the codebase architecture to satisfy tool defaults

      The codebase embodies domain knowledge and architectural decisions.
      Tools are interchangeable utilities. Priorities must reflect this.
    applies_to:
      - "Sphinx configuration vs Python re-exports"
      - "Linter rules vs coding standards"
      - "IDE refactoring suggestions"
      - "Any tool that suggests 'restructuring' code"
    added: "2025-12-11"
    context: |
      Sphinx autosummary was documenting re-exported classes twice.
      Rather than flatten the API surface (removing re-exports from __init__.py),
      we configured Sphinx with `autosummary_imported_members = False`.
      The re-export pattern is intentional Python API design.

  differentiate_structural_issues:
    text: |
      Differentiate between structural issues in the codebase
      and structural issues with the tooling.
    meaning: |
      When a tool reports "problems," diagnose the actual source:

      CODEBASE ISSUES (fix the code):
      - Circular imports
      - Duplicated logic
      - Missing type hints
      - Actual bugs

      TOOLING ISSUES (fix the tool config):
      - Documentation generation quirks
      - Formatter opinion differences
      - Static analyzer false positives
      - Default configurations that don't match our patterns

      Misdiagnosing leads to either:
      - Unnecessary refactoring (treating tool issues as code issues)
      - Hidden bugs (treating code issues as tool quirks)
    applies_to:
      - "Responding to CI warnings"
      - "Evaluating linter suggestions"
      - "Documentation build errors"
    added: "2025-12-11"

# =============================================================================
# QUALITY MANTRAS
# =============================================================================

  block_on_correctness:
    text: "Block on correctness, not style."
    meaning: |
      CI should fail on:
      - Type errors (bugs waiting to happen)
      - Test failures (broken functionality)
      - Lint errors (likely bugs)

      CI should NOT block on:
      - Formatting differences (handled by pre-commit)
      - Documentation style
      - Optional improvements

      Style is enforced locally via pre-commit hooks.
      CI protects correctness, not aesthetics.
    applies_to:
      - "CI pipeline design"
      - "PR review standards"
      - "Pre-commit hook selection"
    reference: "ADR021_cicd_philosophy"

  test_logic_not_ai:
    text: "Test logic deterministically. Evaluate AI probabilistically."
    meaning: |
      Logic tests (math, ledger, topology) must be deterministic.
      Same input always produces same output. No flakiness allowed.

      AI tests are evaluations, not assertions. They check quality
      of generated content, which is inherently variable.

      Never mix these in the same test file or pytest marker.
    applies_to:
      - "Test organization"
      - "CI pipeline structure"
      - "Debugging test failures"

# =============================================================================
# DOCUMENTATION MANTRAS
# =============================================================================

  explain_why_not_what:
    text: "Document WHY, not WHAT. Code shows WHAT."
    meaning: |
      Comments and documentation should explain:
      - Why this approach was chosen
      - What tradeoffs were considered
      - Historical context for decisions

      NOT:
      - What the code literally does (read the code)
      - Step-by-step narration of implementation
    applies_to:
      - "Code comments"
      - "ADR documentation"
      - "Docstrings"

  docstrings_enable_sphinx:
    text: "Docstrings are the source of truth for Sphinx documentation."
    meaning: |
      Every public class, function, and module should have docstrings
      that work with Sphinx autodoc. Use RST formatting correctly:
      - Proper code blocks with :: or ``backticks``
      - Correct emphasis: *italic* and **bold**
      - Valid cross-references: :class:`ClassName`
      - Example sections that pass doctest

      Sphinx warnings about docstring formatting indicate documentation
      that will render incorrectly. Treat as errors.
    applies_to:
      - "Writing new code"
      - "Code review"
      - "Documentation CI"

# DESIGN MANTRAS
# =============================================================================

  red_is_pain:
    text: "Red is Pain, not Decoration."
    meaning: |
      Use #D40000 (phosphor_burn_red) ONLY for critical alerts, ruptures,
      and pain states. Never for decorative borders, inactive elements,
      or general emphasis.

      Red demands attention. Overuse dilutes its power.
      When everything is urgent, nothing is urgent.
    applies_to:
      - "UI component design"
      - "Alert system implementation"
      - "Color selection for states"
    anti_pattern: "Using red for decorative borders or inactive elements"
    reference: "ai-docs/design-system.yaml:palette.semantic.phosphor_burn_red"
    added: "2025-12-14"

  purple_is_life_green_is_data:
    text: "Purple is Life, Green is Data."
    meaning: |
      Distinguish the AI's voice from the System's metrics:

      - PURPLE (#9D00FF, grow_light_purple): AI Narrative, Life, Broadcast
        The Signal. What the AI generates. Organic, alive, growing.

      - GREEN (#39FF14, data_green): Metrics, Terminal Output, Statistics
        The Carrier. What the system measures. Digital, precise, factual.

      This separation lets players immediately identify AI-generated content
      versus mechanical system data.
    applies_to:
      - "Narrative display styling"
      - "Metrics/statistics formatting"
      - "Terminal output design"
    reference: "ai-docs/design-system.yaml:palette.semantic"
    added: "2025-12-14"

  screen_is_physical:
    text: "The Screen is a Physical Object."
    meaning: |
      The UI represents a CRT monitor in a damp basement, not a clean web app.
      Grain, scanlines, and vignette are ESSENTIAL, not optional decorations.

      Implementation requirements:
      - CRT scanline overlay (horizontal lines)
      - Vignette effect (edge darkening)
      - Subtle grain texture
      - Occasional flicker (intentional imperfection)

      If it looks like a modern web app, something is wrong.
    applies_to:
      - "Root UI container styling"
      - "Visual effect implementation"
      - "Aesthetic consistency reviews"
    reference: "ai-docs/design-system.yaml:components.crt_overlay"
    added: "2025-12-14"
