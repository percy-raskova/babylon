# MOTIVATION
# =============================================================================

motivation:
  problem: |
    Current tune_parameters.py only tells us "periphery died at tick 27".
    We need to see the FULL STORY:
    - How wealth flows between all 4 entities over time
    - When consciousness rises/falls and WHY
    - The exact moment P(S|R) crosses P(S|A)
    - How the imperial rent pool grows or shrinks

  insight: |
    The Imperial Collapse Dynamic discovery shows emergent behavior exists.
    But we can only find it by watching trajectories, not endpoints.
    "Greedy empires collapse" required seeing wealth drain RATE, not just death tick.

  goal: |
    Enable rich observational data collection for:
    1. Parameter tuning (find playable boundaries)
    2. Theory validation (does model match MLM-TW predictions?)
    3. Emergent behavior discovery (what dynamics arise?)

# KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
# =============================================================================

research_questions:

  imperial_dynamics:
    - question: "At what extraction rate does C_b start LOSING wealth?"
      hypothesis: "High extraction kills periphery before rent accumulates"
      metric: "c_b_wealth trajectory over time"

    - question: "Is there a 'Goldilocks zone' for sustainable empire?"
      hypothesis: "Some extraction rate keeps periphery barely alive indefinitely"
      metric: "p_w_wealth stable above death threshold"

    - question: "How does super_wage_rate affect imperial stability?"
      hypothesis: "Higher super-wages drain C_b faster but keep C_w loyal"
      metric: "Grid search extraction × super_wage"

  consciousness_dynamics:
    - question: "When does Labor Aristocracy consciousness start rising?"
      hypothesis: "Only when super-wages drop below value produced"
      metric: "c_w_consciousness trajectory vs c_w_wages"

    - question: "What triggers revolutionary crossover in periphery?"
      hypothesis: "P(S|R) > P(S|A) when wealth drops AND organization rises"
      metric: "crossover_tick vs organization level"

  fascist_bifurcation:
    - question: "Without solidarity edges, does agitation produce fascism?"
      hypothesis: "Same material conditions, different outcomes based on solidarity"
      metric: "Compare scenarios with solidarity=0 vs solidarity>0"
      reference: "ADR016_fascist_bifurcation"

  system_behavior:
    - question: "Is total system wealth conserved?"
      hypothesis: "Wealth transfers, doesn't create/destroy (closed system)"
      metric: "system_wealth_total should be constant"

    - question: "What feedback loops exist?"
      hypothesis: |
        - Extraction → wealth loss → consciousness rise → resistance → less extraction
        - Super-wages → false consciousness → less resistance → more extraction
      metric: "Correlation analysis in time-series data"
