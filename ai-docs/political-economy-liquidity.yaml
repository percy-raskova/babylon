# CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
# =============================================================================

conceptual_framework:
  core_insight: |
    Money in Babylon is not wealth - it is the CAPACITY TO ACT.
    Without liquidity, agents cannot execute their strategies regardless
    of their material position or ideological commitment.

    This creates the fundamental tension:
    - The State must SPEND to maintain order (repression + social reproduction)
    - Revolutionaries must FUND operations while avoiding corruption
    - Both face trade-offs that reveal their class character

  state_view:
    name: "Fictitious Capital & Imperial Rent"
    description: |
      The capitalist state commands two sources of "money from nothing":

      1. FICTITIOUS CAPITAL (Debt/Money Printing)
         - State issues bonds or prints currency
         - Creates inflation that devalues workers' wages
         - A hidden tax on the proletariat
         - Finite: hyperinflation destroys legitimacy

      2. IMPERIAL RENT (Tribute from Periphery)
         - Value extracted via unequal exchange
         - Flows through CLIENT_STATE edges in topology
         - Funds super-wages for labor aristocracy
         - Finite: peripheral revolution cuts the flow

    dialectic: |
      The state appears omnipotent (can print money!) but is actually
      constrained by material reality. Inflation erodes real wages,
      creating the conditions for its own negation.

  revolutionary_view:
    name: "Logistics vs. Purity"
    description: |
      Revolutionary organizations face the fundamental contradiction:

      LOGISTICS: Operations require money
      - Safe houses, printing presses, weapons, food
      - Organizers need to eat, families need support
      - "An army marches on its stomach" - Napoleon

      PURITY: Money corrupts
      - Bourgeois funding comes with strings attached
      - Reformist drift follows liberal dollars
      - Expropriation invites state repression

      The revolutionary must navigate this without becoming
      what they sought to destroy.

    dialectic: |
      The party that refuses all compromise starves.
      The party that compromises too much becomes the enemy.
      Only correct analysis of material conditions resolves this.

  the_precarity_thesis: |
    Real wages determine consciousness more than nominal wages.

    A worker earning $50,000/year in a city where rent is $40,000
    is more precarious than one earning $30,000 where rent is $10,000.

    Inflation is class warfare conducted through monetary policy:
    - Wages are sticky (slow to adjust)
    - Prices are flexible (fast to rise)
    - The gap is extracted surplus value

    As inflation rises, the "comfortable" labor aristocrat discovers
    they are one paycheck from proletarianization.

  state_fiscal_trilemma:
    name: "The Fiscal Trilemma"
    description: |
      The state must pay its burn rate every tick or face consequences.
      It has three funding sources, each with costs:

      1. TAX: Extract from domestic bourgeoisie
         - Pro: No inflation, no imperial dependency
         - Con: Bourgeoisie anger, capital flight, investment strike

      2. TRIBUTE: Imperial rent from periphery
         - Pro: No domestic costs, funds super-wages
         - Con: Requires imperial apparatus, vulnerable to peripheral revolt

      3. DEBT: Print money / issue bonds
         - Pro: Immediate liquidity, no direct antagonism
         - Con: Inflation erodes real wages, eventual hyperinflation

      The trilemma: You cannot maximize all three. Choose your class character.

# THEORETICAL NOTES

theoretical_notes:
  on_fictitious_capital: |
    Marx distinguished between money-capital (M) and fictitious capital.

    Money-capital represents claims on real value (commodities, labor-power).
    Fictitious capital represents claims on FUTURE value extraction.

    State debt is fictitious capital: a promise to extract future surplus.
    When the state prints money, it creates a claim without corresponding value.
    This claim is redeemed through inflation - a hidden tax on wage-earners.

    The genius of modern capitalism is making this extraction invisible.
    Workers see their nominal wages rise while real purchasing power falls.
    Only Marxist analysis reveals the mechanism.

  on_imperial_rent: |
    Samir Amin and the dependency theorists showed that "free trade" between
    unequal nations transfers value from periphery to core.

    This value appears in the core as:
    1. Super-profits for capital (higher rate of return)
    2. Super-wages for labor (buying off the working class)
    3. State revenue (taxes on super-profits, tribute from client states)

    The labor aristocracy's "middle class" lifestyle depends on this transfer.
    Their class consciousness is mediated by their material stake in imperialism.

    When imperial rent flows are disrupted (peripheral revolt, rival imperialism),
    the material basis for labor aristocracy consciousness erodes.

  on_the_vanguard_funding_problem: |
    Lenin faced this problem concretely. The Bolsheviks needed money:
    - Iskra printing and distribution
    - Full-time revolutionary cadre
    - Arms for the coming insurrection

    Solutions:
    1. Member dues (limited by worker poverty)
    2. Wealthy sympathizers (Gorky, Morozov) - with drift risk
    3. Expropriations (Tiflis robbery) - with heat risk
    4. Foreign funding (German money in 1917) - with dependency risk

    The correct balance depends on the concrete situation.
    A party in a revolutionary situation can take more heat.
    A party in reaction must preserve cadre and avoid exposure.

    There is no formula - only correct analysis of material conditions.
