# ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE
# =============================================================================

principle:
  name: "RAG as Permission System"
  statement: >
    The RAG corpus defines what IS POSSIBLE in Babylon's world.
    If player input has no semantic neighbors in the corpus, it doesn't exist
    in this material reality. This aligns with historical materialism - you can
    only act within material conditions, not conjure arbitrary outcomes.

  corollary: >
    Creative freedom emerges from COMBINATION of valid elements,
    not injection of invalid ones. Players construct sentences from our
    vocabulary; the LLM interprets semantics.

        "Shock" = Vector distance from previous turn's state.
        High shock indicates dramatic state change, triggering
        more dramatic narrative language.

      drift_detection: |
        Compare current state to historical trajectory.
        Detect when simulation is "drifting" toward known outcomes

# =============================================================================
# COMPOSITIONALITY GRAMMAR
# =============================================================================

compositionality:
  principle: >
    Valid player actions = valid verbs + valid objects + valid modifiers.
    This is like a grammar: we define the vocabulary, players construct
    sentences, LLM interprets the semantic combination.

  examples:
    invalid:
      - input: "Cast fireball"
        reason: "No valid verb 'cast', no valid object 'fireball'"

      - input: "Summon alien army"
        reason: "No valid verb 'summon', no valid object 'alien'"

    valid_novel:
      - input: "Organize an underground railroad for workers"
        parsing:
          verb: "organize (ACT_012)"
          object: "workers (ENT_proletariat)"
          modifier: "underground (clandestine)"
        interpretation: "LLM interprets as secret labor movement"

      - input: "Spread samizdat through the factory"
        parsing:
          verb: "spread (ACT_045 - spread_propaganda)"
          object: "factory (ENT_institution_factory)"
          modifier: "samizdat (clandestine literature)"
        interpretation: "LLM interprets as underground publishing"

  creativity_boundary: >
    Creativity comes from novel COMBINATIONS of valid elements.
    The vocabulary constrains, the grammar liberates.

# =============================================================================
# SAFETY NET: OBSERVER PATTERN
# =============================================================================

safety_architecture:
  principle: >
    Even if validation fails, the simulation engine is deterministic.
    The LLM CANNOT change world state directly. It only describes
    what the engine calculates. Worst case is weird narrative,
    but mechanics remain uncorrupted.

  layer_separation:
    engine: "Pure math, no LLM involvement"
    observer: "LLM generates narrative FROM engine output"
    validation: "RAG gates what reaches LLM"

  failure_modes:
    false_positive_reject:
      description: "Valid creative input incorrectly rejected"
      impact: "Frustrating UX"
      mitigation: "Tiered responses with suggestions"

    false_negative_accept:
      description: "Invalid input sneaks through validation"
      impact: "Thematically weird narrative"
      mitigation: "Engine mechanics unaffected, log for analysis"

    injection_success:
      description: "Prompt injection reaches LLM"
      impact: "LLM may produce off-topic output"
      mitigation: "Output validator catches it, engine unaffected"

# =============================================================================
# CHROMADB CONFIGURATION SPECIFICATION
# =============================================================================

configuration_spec:
  description: |
    The "Type System" for vectors. This configuration ensures ChromaDB acts
    as a Physics Engine with proper filtering capabilities, not just a search bar.
    Metadata schemas enable queries like "Find resonance in 1930s Germany".

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Global Settings
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  global_settings:
    distance_function: "cosine"
    distance_rationale: |
      Cosine distance measures semantic ANGLE between vectors, not magnitude.
      This is crucial because:
      - Documents of different lengths should compare fairly
      - Semantic similarity is about direction in embedding space
      - Magnitude differences (document length) shouldn't skew results
      Formula: 1 - (A·B / ||A|| ||B||)
      Range: [0, 2] where 0 = identical direction, 2 = opposite

    persistence_path: "data/chroma"
    persistence_rationale: |
      Local SQLite + parquet storage within project directory.
      Benefits:
      - No external server required (Embedded Trinity principle)
      - Portable with save games
      - Can be backed up with git-lfs if needed

    embedding_model: "text-embedding-3-small"
    embedding_dimensions: 1536
    embedding_rationale: |
      OpenAI's small model balances quality and cost.
      For offline/local mode, can swap to sentence-transformers.
