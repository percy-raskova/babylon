overview: |
  The complete arc of imperial system collapse: from peripheral extraction through
  internal colonization to the terminal decision point between revolution and genocide.
  When exploitation becomes unprofitable and repression unsustainable, elimination
  becomes the "solution."

  key_ratios:
    exploited_bribed_owners: "100:10:1"
    conditions:
      - "Extraction exceeds super-wage costs → C_b accumulates"
      - "LA is bribed into complicity → social peace in core"
      - "Periphery is distant → exploitation invisible"

phases:
  peripheral_revolt:
    number: 1
    triggers:
      - "Ecological collapse (metabolic rift exhausts biocapacity)"
      - "Peripheral organization (P(S|R) exceeds P(S|A))"
      - "Anti-colonial revolution severs extraction edges"
    effects:
      - "Imperial rent stops flowing"
      - "C_b loses tribute inflow"
      - "Super-wage budget depletes"
      - "LA begins proletarianization"

  arithmetic_failure:

    fundamental_contradiction: "Internal colonization cannot scale"
    ratio_comparison:
      imperial_model: "1 guard : 100 periphery workers (distance + military power)"
      carceral_model: "1 guard : 10 prisoners (proximity + constant surveillance)"
    progression:

        ratio: "1:10"
        stability: "Revolt imminent"
    breakpoint: "prisoners > guards × control_capacity"

  terminal_decision:
    number: 4
    description: "System faces bifurcation between revolution and genocide"
    outcomes:
      revolution:
        condition: "Prisoners + guards unite against C_b"
        result: "C_b wealth → 0, system ends"
      genocide:
        condition: "Eliminate surplus population"
        result: "C_b costs → 0 (temporarily)"

  stages:

      function: "Extract labor + warehouse"
      value_extracted: "Medium"
      violence_level: "Systematic"
      population_status: "Break-even (some labor, high costs)"

      function: "Elimination"
      value_extracted: "Negative (saves costs)"
      violence_level: "Genocidal"
      population_status: "Eliminated (liability removed)"

genocidal_logic:
  pseudocode: |
    cost_of_warehousing = prisoners × (food + shelter + guards + infrastructure)
    value_of_labor = prisoners × (productivity × extraction_rate)
    risk_of_revolt = prisoners / (guards × control_capacity)

    if cost_of_warehousing > value_of_labor:
        if risk_of_revolt > acceptable_threshold:
            decision = GENOCIDE
  insight: "When exploitation unprofitable and repression unsustainable, elimination becomes 'solution'"

historical_parallels:
  nazi_germany:
    - "Lost colonies (WWI) → imperial extraction ended"
    - "Economic crisis → LA proletarianization"
    - "Internal colonization → target Jews, Roma, disabled, communists"
    - "Concentration camps → warehousing + some labor"
    - "Death camps → Final Solution when warehousing costs exceeded value"

  american_trajectory:
    - "Deindustrialization → LA begins shrinking"
    - "War on Drugs → mass incarceration begins"
    - "Prison-industrial complex → extraction from prison labor"
    - "Private prisons → cost optimization pressure"
