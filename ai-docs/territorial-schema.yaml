# Territorial Schema: Settler-Colonial Geography
# ================================================
#
# The United States is not a post-colonial nation but an ONGOING
# settler-colonial project. This schema encodes that reality into
# geographic mechanics.
#
# Three territory types, three extraction logics:
# - OGV: Control of ADMINISTRATION (settler citadels)
# - OPC: Control of LABOR (human beings)
# - Frontier: Control of LAND (resources)

  core_insight: |
    The Volksgemeinschaft (White Settler Nation) is not an identity—
    it's a material relationship to land, labor, and imperial rent.
    Territory types encode WHO extracts WHAT from WHOM.

# =============================================================================
# THE VOLKSGEMEINSCHAFT
# =============================================================================

volksgemeinschaft:
  definition: |
    The "people's community" of the white settler nation. Not all white
    people—specifically those whose material interests are tied to the
    settler-colonial project and who receive imperial rent (super-wages,
    land access, state protection).

    The Volksgemeinschaft is both:
    - A material category (who benefits from settler-colonialism)
    - An ideological project (who is interpellated as "real American")

  membership:
    automatic:
      - "White property owners"
      - "White professionals in OGV"
      - "White military/police"
    conditional:
      - "Poor whites (offered 'whiteness wage' but materially in OPC)"
      - "Model minorities (conditional, revocable)"
    excluded:
      - "Black Americans (internal colony)"
      - "Indigenous peoples (ongoing colonization)"
      - "Undocumented immigrants (exploitable labor)"
      - "Incarcerated people (penal labor)"

  ideology:
    explicit: "America First, Christian nationalism, MAGA"
    implicit: "Meritocracy, colorblindness, law and order"
    # The implicit form IS liberalism in decay

# TERRITORY TYPE 1: OGV (Occupation Garrisons of Volksgemeinschaft)
# =============================================================================

ogv:
  full_name: "Occupation Garrisons of the Volksgemeinschaft"
  shorthand: OGV

  definition: |
    The citadels of the white settler nation. "Home territory that's a colony."
    Administrative enclaves where the bureaucracy of empire operates.
    These are settler outposts on stolen land that function as "home" for
    the Volksgemeinschaft.

  purpose: ADMINISTRATION

# =============================================================================

opc:
  full_name: "Occupied Penal Colonies"
  shorthand: OPC

  definition: |
    Internal colonies for the administration and control of LABOR POWER.
    Human beings as the resource being managed. These territories exist
    to extract surplus value from colonized and marginalized populations
    while containing their revolutionary potential.

  purpose: LABOR_CONTROL
  what_is_controlled: "Human beings—labor power"

  characteristics:
    population:
      primary: "Colonized workers (Black, Indigenous, immigrant)"

# TERRITORY TYPE 3: FRONTIER
# =============================================================================

frontier:
  full_name: "The Frontier"
  shorthand: Frontier

  definition: |
    Extractive territories for control of LAND AND RESOURCES.
    The ongoing settler-colonial project in its most visible form.
    These are the spaces between—vast, sparse, treated as empty
    (though they are Indigenous land).

  purpose: RESOURCE_EXTRACTION
  what_is_controlled: "Land—as dead matter to be extracted"

  characteristics:
    population:
      primary: "Indigenous nations (colonized, resisting)"
      secondary: "Extraction workers (oil, mining, agriculture)"
      tertiary: "Sparse settlers"

  subtypes:
    reservation:
      description: |
        Indigenous reservations are a special Frontier subtype.
        Land belongs to Indigenous peoples (treaty rights, sovereignty).
        But practically, Volksgemeinschaft administers and extracts.
      mechanics:
        sovereignty_level: "Nominal—limited self-governance"

# EXTRACTION FLOWS
# =============================================================================

extraction_flows:
  description: |
    The three territory types exist in a relationship of extraction.
    Value flows FROM OPC and Frontier TO OGV.
    This is the geographic expression of imperial rent.

  flows:
    - from: OPC
      to: OGV
      what: "Labor surplus value"
      mechanism: "Low wages, rent extraction, prison labor"

    - from: Frontier
      to: OGV
      what: "Resources (land value)"
      mechanism: "Extraction industries, water rights, agriculture"

    - from: OPC
      to: OGV
      what: "Social reproduction"
      mechanism: "Care work, domestic labor, service economy"

  imperial_rent_formula: |
    Φ = (V_opc - W_opc) + (V_frontier - W_frontier)

    Where:
    - Φ = Imperial rent received by OGV
    - V = Value produced
    - W = Wages paid

    OGV workers receive W_ogv = V_ogv + Φ
    (Their wages exceed local value production because of extraction)

# =============================================================================
# BIFURCATION BY TERRITORY
# =============================================================================

bifurcation:
  description: |
    When crisis hits (wage_change < 0), energy must route somewhere.
    Territory type affects which direction is more likely.

  by_territory:
    ogv:
      default_route: fascism
      why: |
        OGV populations have no solidarity edges to colonized peoples.
        When their super-wages are threatened, they blame the "other"
        rather than recognize shared class interest.
      revolution_requires: "Massive crisis + prebuilt solidarity edges"

    opc:
      default_route: contested
      why: |
        OPC is the battleground. Colonized populations route to revolution.
        Poor whites can go either way—depends on organizing.
      revolution_requires: "Solidarity organizing before crisis"
      fascism_path: "Volksgemeinschaft recruits poor whites"

    frontier:
      default_route: indigenous_resistance
      why: |
        Indigenous peoples experience colonization directly and continuously.
        Revolutionary consciousness is not about "awakening"—it's survival.
      alliance_potential: "Can ally with OPC revolutionary movements"

# GAME TIMELINE
# =============================================================================

game_timeline:
  description: |
    The game follows Mao Zedong's Protracted People's War framework:
    - Stage 1: Strategic Defensive (enemy offensive, we resist)
    - Stage 2: Strategic Stalemate (equilibrium, we build strength)
    - Stage 3: Strategic Counter-Offensive (we attack, victory)

    The Purge marks the transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2.
    Victory is achieved in Stage 3.

  theoretical_basis:
    source: "On Protracted War (May 1938)"
    author: "Mao Zedong"
    key_insight: |
      "Whether China becomes an independent country or is reduced to a
      colony will be determined not by the retention or loss of the big
      cities in the first stage but by the extent to which the whole
      nation exerts itself in the second."

  pre_stage:
    name: "Coalescence"
    game_name: "Decaying Liberalism"
    duration: "4 in-game years (~48 ticks)"
    description: |
      Before we can fight a protracted war, we must BECOME a movement.

      The player begins with scattered, disparate entities—local organizers,
      affinity groups, community organizations, study circles. These are
      not yet a coherent revolutionary force.

      The 4-year period is about COALESCENCE:
      - Building solidarity edges between isolated groups
      - Developing shared analysis and strategy
      - Creating infrastructure (safe houses, communication, resources)
      - Establishing base areas in OPC and Frontier territories

      The enemy (fascism) is rising. Liberal institutions crumble.
      But we are not yet in the war—we are preparing for it.
    characteristics:
      - "OGV: Liberal consensus fraying, fascism implicit"
      - "OPC: Already under occupation (mass incarceration, police violence)"
      - "Frontier: Extraction intensifying (climate crisis, resource wars)"
      - "Player: Scattered groups, building toward coherence"
    player_goal: "Coalesce into a movement. Survive The Purge."

  the_purge:
    name: "The Purge"
    timing: "End of Year 4 (transition from Coalescence to Stage 1)"
    description: |
      The Sword of Damocles drops. The Volksgemeinschaft consolidates.
      Explicit fascism replaces decaying liberalism.

      The Purge is the TEST OF COALESCENCE:
      "Have we progressed from a scattered amalgamation of disparate
      entities into a coherent enough movement to begin the Defensive phase?"

      If YES: The movement survives. It enters Stage 1 (Strategic Defensive)
      as a coherent revolutionary force capable of fighting a protracted war.

      If NO: The scattered groups are destroyed individually. GAME OVER.

      The Purge targets:
      - Revolutionary organizers (arrests, disappearances)
      - Solidarity networks (edges attacked)
      - OPC resistance infrastructure (raids, destruction)
      - Frontier resistance camps (military assault)

      What determines survival (coherence):
      - Solidarity edge density (are groups connected?)
      - Organization strength (can they coordinate?)
      - Infrastructure (can they survive underground?)
      - Geographic dispersion (not all eggs in one basket)
    outcomes:
      survive: "Enter Stage 1 (Strategic Defensive) as a coherent movement"
      crushed: "GAME OVER - scattered groups destroyed individually"

  stage_1:
    name: "Strategic Defensive"
    mao_term: "Enemy's Strategic Offensive / Our Strategic Defensive"
    game_name: "Resistance Under Fascism (Early)"
    duration: "Indefinite (until stalemate emerges)"
    description: |
      We survived The Purge. We are now a COHERENT MOVEMENT.

      From Mao: "In this stage, in spite of considerable losses, China
      will make considerable progress, which will become the main basis
      for her continued resistance in the second stage."

      The enemy (fascism) is on the offensive. They control the state.
      We are on the strategic defensive—but we are a real force now.

      Guerrilla warfare. Base areas defended. Underground resistance.
      The enemy attacks; we absorb and counterattack locally.
    characteristics:
      - "OGV: Fully mobilized Volksgemeinschaft (explicit fascism)"
      - "OPC: Under occupation, but resistance organized"
      - "Frontier: Extraction + repression, but Indigenous resistance"
      - "Player: Coherent movement, fighting defensively"
    warfare_form: "Guerrilla warfare, supplemented by mobile warfare"
    player_goal: "Survive enemy offensives. Build base areas. Reach stalemate."
    transition_to_stage_2: |
      When the enemy's offensive capacity is exhausted and neither side
      can decisively defeat the other, the war enters Stage 2 (Stalemate).

  stage_2:
    name: "Strategic Stalemate"
    mao_term: "Strategic Consolidation / Our Preparation for Counter-Offensive"
    game_name: "Resistance Under Fascism"
    duration: "Indefinite (until conditions allow Stage 3)"
    description: |
      The enemy has consolidated but cannot destroy us. We survived.
      Now we build strength from weakness.

      From Mao: "This second stage will be the transitional stage of
      the entire war; it will be the most trying period but also the
      pivotal one... If we can persevere... China will in that stage
      gain the power to change from weakness to strength."

      The enemy attempts to safeguard occupied areas while we conduct
      guerrilla warfare from our surviving base areas.
    characteristics:
      - "OGV: Fully mobilized Volksgemeinschaft (explicit fascism)"
      - "OPC: Escalated repression, camps, deportation"
      - "Frontier: Total extraction, Indigenous elimination accelerated"
      - "Resistance: Underground, hunted, but ALIVE and growing"
    warfare_form: "Primarily guerrilla warfare, supplemented by mobile warfare"
    player_goal: "Persevere. Build strength. Wait for contradictions to sharpen."
    key_dynamics:
      - "Enemy's internal contradictions deepen (can't maintain super-wages)"
      - "Resistance networks grow despite repression"
      - "International solidarity strengthens"
      - "War-weariness in enemy ranks"
    transition_to_stage_3: |
      When player has built sufficient strength AND enemy contradictions
      have sufficiently sharpened, the game offers the option to
      transition to Stage 3 (Counter-Offensive).

  stage_3:
    name: "Strategic Counter-Offensive"
    mao_term: "Our Strategic Counter-Offensive / Enemy's Strategic Retreat"
    game_name: "The Offensive"
    duration: "Until victory or defeat"
    description: |
      From Mao: "The third stage will be the stage of the counter-offensive
      to recover our lost territories... Our war will no longer be one of
      strategic defensive, but will turn into a strategic counter-offensive."

      The resistance goes on the attack. The settler-colonial project
      is challenged directly.
    characteristics:
      - "OGV: Cracking, mass defection possible"
      - "OPC: Liberated zones established"
      - "Frontier: Land Back movements succeed"
      - "Resistance: Open organization, armed struggle"
    warfare_form: "Mobile warfare primary, positional warfare rises to importance"
    player_goal: "Recover lost territory. Destroy the enemy. Victory."
    key_dynamics:
      - "Mass defection from Volksgemeinschaft (rats leaving ship)"
      - "Dual power structures emerge"
      - "International intervention (for or against)"
      - "Final confrontation"

  victory_state:
    name: "Revolution"
    description: |
      Achieved at the end of Stage 3.
      The settler-colonial project is overthrown.
      The Volksgemeinschaft is dissolved.
      A new society begins.

      From Mao: "Not until we fight our way to the Yalu River can this
      war be considered over."

      Victory requires completing the full arc:
      - Stage 1: Build base areas, survive The Purge
      - Stage 2: Persevere in stalemate, build strength from weakness
      - Stage 3: Go on the offensive, recover lost territory

        - "Movement has defended base areas"
        - "Neither side gaining ground"
      description: |
        The transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 is not a single event
        but an emergent condition. The war shifts from enemy offensive
        to stalemate when the fascist state can no longer destroy the
        resistance but the resistance cannot yet challenge state power.

    stage_2_to_3:
      trigger: "Player choice (when conditions met)"
      requirements:

        - "International conditions favorable (optional bonus)"
      failure_if_premature: "Offensive crushed, back to Stage 2 (weakened)"

# =============================================================================
# LIBERALISM: THE DECAYING ORDER
# =============================================================================

liberalism:
  status: "design_pending"
  notes: |
    Liberalism is not a faction—it's the STARTING CONDITION.
    It's the ideology that enables both outcomes while claiming neutrality.

    Key insight: Liberalism IS implicit fascism.
    - "Law and order" = police occupation of OPC
    - "Meritocracy" = justification of extraction
    - "Colorblindness" = denial of settler-colonialism
    - "Property rights" = defense of stolen land

    The game doesn't have a "liberal faction" because liberalism is the
    water everyone is swimming in at game start. It's what's DECAYING.

    Future enhancement: Model liberal institutions (courts, media, elections)
    as terrain that both sides fight over during the transition.
