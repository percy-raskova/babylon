# Theoretical Foundation

Babylon's mechanics are grounded in Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Third Worldist (MLM-TW) theory. This document explains the theory so AI assistants can understand *why* the game works the way it does.

## Core Thesis

**Revolution in the imperial core is structurally impossible while imperial rent extraction continues.**

This isn't a moral claim or a prediction—it's a mechanical constraint that emerges from material conditions. The game models this mathematically.

## The Fundamental Theorem

```
If W_c > V_c, then P(Revolution in Core) → 0
```

Where:
- **W_c** = Wages paid to core (First World) workers
- **V_c** = Value produced by core workers
- **Φ = W_c - V_c** = Imperial Rent

When Φ > 0, core workers receive more value than they produce. The difference comes from exploitation of peripheral (Third World) workers through unequal exchange.

### Implications

1. Core workers have *material interest* in maintaining imperialism
2. This creates the **labor aristocracy**—workers whose class interest aligns with capital against the global proletariat
3. Revolutionary potential is concentrated in the periphery, not the core

## Key Concepts

### Imperial Rent (Φ)

The mechanism by which value flows from periphery to core. Not just exploitation of peripheral workers, but a transfer that *elevates* core workers above subsistence.

**In-game**: Determines which regions can achieve revolutionary rupture. High Φ → low revolutionary potential.

### Labor Aristocracy

Workers in the imperial core who benefit from imperial rent. They are exploited by *their own* capitalists but receive net benefit from global exploitation.

**In-game**: A class category with high wages, high consumption, low revolutionary potential. Can be allies of capital against global proletariat.

### Unequal Exchange

The systematic undervaluation of peripheral labor relative to core labor. An hour of work in the periphery exchanges for less than an hour in the core.

**In-game**: Modifies resource and value flows between locations.

### Contradiction

A dialectical tension between opposing forces. Not a "problem" but a *dynamic* that drives historical change.

Types:
- **Antagonistic**: Cannot be resolved within the current system (capital vs. labor)
- **Non-antagonistic**: Can be resolved through reform (tactical disagreements)

**In-game**: Contradictions have intensity levels. When intensity reaches critical threshold, rupture becomes possible.

### Rupture

Revolutionary break with the existing order. Not inevitable—requires both conditions (material) and organization (subjective).

**Formula**:
```
P(Rupture) when: P(S|R) > P(S|A)

Where:
P(S|R) = Probability of Survival through Revolution
       = Organization / Repression

P(S|A) = Probability of Survival through Acquiescence
       = Sigmoid(Wealth - Subsistence)
```

Revolution becomes rational when survival odds are better through revolt than compliance.

### Hegemony (Gramsci)

Ruling class power maintained through cultural/ideological control, not just coercion. The ruling class shapes what counts as "common sense."

**In-game**: Planned as wiki control mechanic—factions that control narrative control what players perceive as reality.

### Atomization

Destruction of organic social bonds, replaced by market relations. Workers isolated, unable to organize collectively.

**In-game**: Reduces organization capacity, increases threshold for rupture.

## Class Categories

| Class | Relation to Production | Revolutionary Potential |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Bourgeoisie | Owns means of production | Counter-revolutionary |
| Proletariat | Sells labor power | High (in periphery) |
| Petty Bourgeoisie | Small owners, professionals | Vacillating |
| Peasantry | Agricultural producers | Variable by context |
| Labor Aristocracy | Core workers with Φ benefit | Low |
| Lumpenproletariat | Outside formal economy | Unreliable |

## Why This Matters for Game Design

### Mechanics Follow Theory

Every game mechanic should trace back to theoretical principle:

- Economic systems model value extraction, not just resource management
- Political systems model class power, not just popularity
- Events emerge from contradictions, not random chance
- Revolutionary potential follows material conditions, not player choice alone

### Not Moralism

The game doesn't preach. It models. If the mathematics say revolution in the core is unlikely, the player experiences that as mechanical resistance, not a lecture.

### Educational Through Play

Players learn materialist analysis by *doing* it:
- Why does this region revolt and not that one? (Check Φ)
- Why do workers vote against their interests? (Check hegemony)
- Why does reform fail? (Check antagonistic vs. non-antagonistic contradictions)

## Sources

The theoretical framework draws from:

- Marx's *Capital* (value theory, exploitation)
- Lenin's *Imperialism* (monopoly capital, labor aristocracy)
- Mao's *On Contradiction* (dialectical analysis)
- Gramsci's *Prison Notebooks* (hegemony, civil society)
- Zak Cope's *Divided World Divided Class* (modern labor aristocracy thesis)
- Samir Amin's *Unequal Development* (unequal exchange)

## For AI Assistants

When working on Babylon:

1. **Ground mechanics in theory**: Ask "which theoretical concept does this model?"
2. **Avoid idealism**: Material conditions are primary, ideas secondary
3. **Class analysis first**: Ask "which class benefits?" before designing features
4. **Dialectical thinking**: Look for contradictions, not just states
5. **No both-sides-ism**: Oppressor and oppressed are not equivalent

The game's unique value is its theoretical coherence. Preserve it.
