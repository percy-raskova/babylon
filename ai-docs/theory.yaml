overview: |
  Babylon models the collapse of American hegemony through MLM-TW theory.
  Revolution in the imperial core is structurally impossible while imperial
  rent extraction continues. This is a mechanical constraint, not a moral claim.

fundamental_theorem:
  statement: "If W_c > V_c, then P(Revolution in Core) → 0"
  variables:
    W_c: "Wages paid to core (First World) workers"
    V_c: "Value produced by core workers"
    Phi: "Imperial Rent (Φ = W_c - V_c)"
  implications:
    - "Core workers have material interest in maintaining imperialism"
    - "This creates the labor aristocracy whose class interest aligns with capital"
    - "Revolutionary potential is concentrated in the periphery, not the core"
  implemented_in: "src/babylon/systems/formulas/imperial_rent.py"

key_concepts:
  imperial_rent:
    definition: "Value flowing from periphery to core that elevates core workers above subsistence"
    formula: "Φ = W_c - V_c"
    game_effect: "High Φ → low revolutionary potential in region"
    see_also: "docs/concepts/imperial-rent.rst"

  labor_aristocracy:
    definition: "Core workers who benefit from imperial rent, exploited by own capitalists but receiving net benefit from global exploitation"
    threshold: "W_c / V_c > 1"
    game_effect: "High wages, high consumption, low revolutionary potential"
    implemented_in: "src/babylon/systems/formulas/imperial_rent.py::is_labor_aristocracy"

  unequal_exchange:
    definition: "Systematic undervaluation of peripheral labor relative to core labor"
    effect: "An hour of work in periphery exchanges for less than an hour in core"
    implemented_in: "src/babylon/systems/formulas/unequal_exchange.py"

  contradiction:
    definition: "Dialectical tension between opposing forces that drives historical change"
    types:
      antagonistic: "Cannot be resolved within current system (capital vs labor)"
      non_antagonistic: "Can be resolved through reform (tactical disagreements)"
    game_effect: "Intensity reaches critical threshold → rupture becomes possible"
    implemented_in: "src/babylon/engine/systems/contradiction.py"

  rupture:
    definition: "Revolutionary break with existing order - requires both material conditions and organization"
    formula: "P(Rupture) when P(S|R) > P(S|A)"

  atomization:
    definition: "Destruction of organic social bonds replaced by market relations"
    game_effect: "Reduces organization capacity, increases rupture threshold"

survival_calculus:
  p_acquiescence:
    formula: "P(S|A) = Sigmoid(Wealth - Subsistence)"
    meaning: "Probability of survival by working within system"
  p_revolution:

    meaning: "Probability of survival by revolutionary action"
