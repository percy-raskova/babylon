overview: |
  When imperial rent extraction fails, a NEW MODE OF PRODUCTION emerges from the
  collapse. This is not merely a political change (who holds power) but a transition
  in the relations of production themselves. The revanchist coalition - cops,
  petit-bourgeoisie remnants, decomposed labor aristocracy - establishes the
  necropolitical prison-plantation: rule through the administration of death,
  extraction through direct violence.

  mode_of_production_transition:
    description: |
      The necropolitical prison-plantation is a REGRESSIVE mode of production
      transition - what happens when capitalism cannot reproduce itself but
      the apparatus of violence remains.
    unlike_capitalism:
      - "No wage labor (violence replaces wages as extraction mechanism)"
      - "No commodity production for exchange (subsistence, not accumulation)"
      - "No value extraction through exploitation (direct appropriation through force)"
    unlike_slavery:
      - "Slaves were valuable property (incentive to preserve)"
      - "This captive population is a LIABILITY (incentive to eliminate)"
    definition: "Necropolitics as mode of production: rule through administration of death"

  settler_colonial_foundation:
    description: |
      The warlord trajectory doesn't CREATE settler colonial violence - it REMOVES
      the economic structures that obscured it. The ideology of racial hierarchy,
      elimination of 'surplus' populations, and local enforcement power has always
      been present. Imperial rent collapse drops the pretense.
    always_present:
      - "Chattel slavery and its afterlives"
      - "Indigenous genocide and land theft"
      - "Convict leasing as slavery's successor"
      - "Mass incarceration as social control"

revanchist_coalition:
  description: "New ruling class formation, not just 'enforcers who want pay'"
  components:
    - name: "Revanchist cops"
      description: "Local police, sheriffs, prison guards (NOT federal military)"
      power_base: "Decentralized, territorial, local loyalty"
    - name: "Petit-bourgeoisie remnants"
      description: "Small business owners, local managers, squeezed out"
      role: "Minor faction, vacillating like peasants in capitalist transition"
    - name: "Decomposed Labor Aristocracy"
      description: "The 15% who became enforcers + those aligned with police power"
      origin: "CLASS_DECOMPOSITION event"

institutional_fracture:
  description: "The key split is between traditional military and local police"
  traditional_military:
    loyalty: "Nation-state ideology (duty, honor, chain of command)"
    allegiance: "Bourgeoisie (federal legitimacy)"
    power_base: "Central, hierarchical"
  local_police:
    loyalty: "Territorial, settler colonial"
    allegiance: "Own coalition (no federal loyalty)"
    power_base: "Decentralized, local"
  insight: "Military stays with bourgeoisie, police form revanchist coalition"

motivation:
  not_economic_grievance: true
  actual_motivation: |
    Settler colonial consciousness dropping pretense when economic mediation fails:
    "We have the guns. We have the prisons. Why are we paying these lazy [slurs]
    when we could eliminate them and take it all?"
  ideology_source: "Pre-existing foundation of American racial capitalism"
  trigger: "Collapse of economic structures (wages, rights, due process)"

  accelerate_warlord:
    description: "Destabilization tactics (risky but creates opportunities)"
    tactics:
      - "Reduce C_b wealth through sabotage (weakens bourgeois faction)"
      - "Disrupt federal payment channels (fractures military loyalty)"
      - "Expose contradictions between military and police"
      - "Amplify settler colonial tensions (accelerates coalition formation)"
    note: "Transition chaos creates revolutionary opportunities, but risks severe"

  prevent_warlord:
    description: "Revolutionary victory path"
    tactics:
      - "Organize prisoners despite conditions (raise organization above 0.5)"
      - "Flip enforcers to revolutionary side (solidarity transmission)"
      - "Build solidarity networks spanning prisoner/enforcer divide"
      - "Connect to periphery revolutionary movements (international solidarity)"
      - "Exploit military/police fracture (neither faction trusts the other)"

  critical_window:
    description: "Transition period is most volatile AND most opportune"
    conditions:
      - "Neither faction has consolidated power"
      - "Captive population desperate (P(S|A) → 0)"
      - "Enforcers face moral injury from role"
    principle: "Warsaw Ghetto Dynamic: when P(S|A) → 0, revolution is only rational choice"

mantras:
  original: "Collapse is certain. Revolution is possible. Organization is the difference."
  extended: "And if revolution fails, the apparatus of death finds new masters."
  final: "The collapse of American hegemony is not the end of history. It is the revelation of what was always underneath."
