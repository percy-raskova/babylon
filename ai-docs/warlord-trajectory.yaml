overview: |
  During 100-year Carceral Equilibrium simulations, bourgeoisie wealth collapsed
  to near-zero while Labor Aristocracy accumulated massively. Initially flagged as
  a bug (ADR037), this represents a historically valid trajectory: the Warlord Coup.
  When bourgeoisie cannot pay enforcers, those who control the actual means of
  violence can seize power.

two_interpretations:
  bug_classical:
    name: "Bug (Classical Political Economy)"
    argument:
      - "Capital should concentrate upward during crisis"
      - "Bourgeoisie should thrive while workers suffer"
      - "This is how capitalism has historically functioned"
    fix: "Add EXPLOITATION edge from LA to C_b"

  feature_warlord:
    name: "Feature (Warlord Trajectory)"
    argument:
      - "When bourgeoisie can't pay enforcers, coup becomes possible"
      - "Enforcers control the actual means of violence"
      - "Historically accurate for failed states and military juntas"
    fix: "Model enforcer class consciousness and loyalty"

resolution: "Both trajectories are valid. Epoch 2 implements branching based on material conditions."

  praetorian_guard:
    description: "Roman Praetorian Guard realized their power over emperors"
    examples:
      - "41 CE: Assassinated Caligula, installed Claudius"
      - "193 CE: Auctioned the empire to the highest bidder"
      - "235-284 CE: Crisis of the Third Century (50 years, 26 emperors)"
    lesson: "When emperors couldn't pay, guards made new emperors"

    context: "American trajectory"
    difference: "Enforcers may not stage coup but become new capitalist class"
    mechanism:
      - "CoreCivic and GEO Group executives"
      - "Prison labor extraction as surplus value source"
      - "Lobbying for criminalization (more prisoners = more profit)"
      - "Revolving door between corrections and government"
    insight: "Enforcers don't need coup - they become new bourgeoisie through carceral apparatus"

epoch2_design:
  trajectory_a:
    name: "Classical Concentration"
    flow: "C_b → maintains payment → Enforcers → control → Prisoners"
    condition: "Bourgeoisie can fix payment (through extreme extraction)"
    result: "Pure necropolis ruled by capitalists"

  trajectory_b:
    name: "Warlord Coup"
    flow: "Enforcers (warlords) → control directly → Prisoners"
    condition: "Enforcers seize power when payment fails"
    result: "Military junta ruling necropolis directly"
    note: "C_b eliminated or subordinated"

player_agency:
  accelerate_warlord_coup:
    - "Reduce C_b wealth through sabotage"
    - "Disrupt payment channels"

  prevent_both_trajectories:
    - "Organize prisoners despite conditions"
    - "Flip enforcers to revolutionary side"
    - "Build solidarity networks spanning class lines"
    - "Exploit transition chaos"

  note: "Warsaw Ghetto Dynamic still applies: when P(S|A) → 0, revolution becomes the only rational choice"

mantras:
  original: "Collapse is certain. Revolution is possible. Organization is the difference."
  extended: "And if revolution fails, even the victors change."
  insight: "Necropolis may be ruled by capitalists or warlords. Either way, only escape is revolutionary organization."
