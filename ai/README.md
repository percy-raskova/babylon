## ACTIVE SPECS (The Truth)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `../reports/aidocs-vs-code-audit-2026-05-16.md` | **LIVING ROADMAP** (owner decision 2026-07-02) — epoch-vs-code audit + 27-spec full-vision catalog in 7 waves. Spec numbers in the catalog are advisory; actual numbers are first-come at spec-creation time (086/097 were consumed by the QCEW data-quality track). |
| `state.yaml` | Current project state, test counts, sprint status |
| `epochs/overview.md` | Historical vision: Four Epochs (Engine, Foundation, Game, Platform). Status tables frozen ~Jan 2026 — see the audit report for what actually shipped. |
| `epochs/epoch1-complete.md` | Epoch 1 completion record (counts as of 2026-01-05; since grown: 25 systems, 70 EventTypes, 55 formula functions) |
| `epochs/epoch2/` | Epoch 2: The Foundation - data infrastructure, H3 (PyQt slice OBSOLETE — React/Django/deck.gl shipped instead, specs 041/042/061) |
| `epochs/epoch3/` | Epoch 3: The Game - game features (17 specs, renumbered from epoch2/; 3.9 Balkanization shipped as spec-070) |
| `epochs/epoch4/` | Epoch 4: The Platform - vision only (DuckDB unification + ChromaDB superseded by Postgres 16 + pgvector, spec-037/ADR030) |
| `architecture.yaml` | Technical Stack (Embedded Trinity: Ledger, Topology, Archive) |
| `tooling.yaml` | CI/CD, Testing, Parameter Tuning, Monte Carlo UQ |
| `formulas-spec.yaml` | Formula signatures (historical; actual: 55 public functions across 17 modules in `src/babylon/formulas/`) |
| `observer-layer.yaml` | Observer system, EventTypes, TopologyMonitor |

## Usage

When starting a session, an AI assistant should:
1. Read `reports/aidocs-vs-code-audit-2026-05-16.md` for the living roadmap (`ai/epochs/overview.md` is the historical vision)
2. Read `ai/state.yaml` for current sprint status and test counts
3. Reference `ai/ontology.yaml` when encountering domain terms
4. Check `ai/patterns.yaml` before implementing new features
5. Consult `ai/decisions/index.yaml` to understand why things are the way they are

## Maintenance

Update these docs when:
- New domain concepts are introduced
- Architectural decisions are made
- Patterns emerge or change
- Mistakes are made (add to anti-patterns)
