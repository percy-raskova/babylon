# Flake evidence: tutorial-pilot screen-transition race under xdist load

**Filed 2026-07-22 ~12:50 EDT by the verification session (bg feb021be), for whichever
session next touches the pilot harness (the interface-refinement train owns that area now).**

**Symptom:** `tests/unit/tui/test_tutorial_pilot.py::TestEachStepOfTheWayneOpeningArc::
test_step_resolves_its_own_then[...economy dossier...Fundamental Theorem verdict...]`
(target_index=7) failed ONCE on dev tip `633de83f` during a full `mise run check`
(12:25 EDT run, concurrent with the interface-refinement train's own workload):

```
textual.css.query.NoMatches: No nodes match '#status' on Screen(id='_default')
```

i.e. `_replay_through` queried the campaign screen's `#status` label while the app's
screen stack was still on the default screen — a Pilot screen-push timing race, not a
state assertion failure.

**Evidence it is a load/timing flake, not an order-pollution or #254 regression:**
- Scoped rerun (`mise run test:q -- tests/unit/tui/test_tutorial_pilot.py::TestEachStepOfTheWayneOpeningArc`): 9/9 green, 19.7s.
- Second full `mise run test:unit` on the SAME tree (12:45 EDT, box quiet): 14,132 passed / 0 failed.
- No file touched by PR #254 is in the failure path (harness + ArchiveApp are T6/T4 code).
- test:unit runs pytest-randomly (order shuffles per run) + xdist `-n 4 --dist loadscope`;
  the failing step's durations run 2.0–2.7s — the slowest in the class — and the first
  failing run shared the box with another session's active workload.

**Suggested fix direction (owner of the harness decides):** condition-based waiting on the
screen push before querying (`await pilot.pause()` loops until `app.screen` is the campaign
screen, bounded), instead of fixed pauses — the Gauntlet ruling already names wall-clock
timing as determinism poison in tests.

Full failure record: the 12:25 run's `reports/test-results/unit/report.json` in the
`verify-north-star` worktree (deleted after verification; longrepr preserved here in
summary). Memory: [[player-interface-shell-design]] session notes.
