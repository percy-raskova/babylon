# Territorial Schema: Design Document

## The Core Thesis

The United States is not a post-colonial nation. It is an **ongoing settler-colonial project**. The game's geography must encode this reality.

Three territory types. Three extraction logics. One Volksgemeinschaft.

---

## The Volksgemeinschaft (White Settler Nation)

Not an identity. A **material relationship**.

The Volksgemeinschaft includes those whose material interests are tied to the settler-colonial project:
- Property owners on stolen land
- Workers receiving super-wages (imperial rent)
- Those protected by the state rather than policed by it

**Membership is not about genetics.** It's about position in the extraction system:
- A poor white in a trailer park is materially in OPC, but offered "honorary" membership
- A "model minority" professional might be conditionally included, until they're not
- A Black billionaire is still excluded from the Volksgemeinschaft (see: how police treat them)

The Volksgemeinschaft offers **whiteness as a wage** (Du Bois). It's the bribe that prevents cross-racial class solidarity.

---

## Territory Type 1: OGV (Occupation Garrisons of Volksgemeinschaft)

### The Citadels

> "Home territory that's a colony."

OGV territories are where the Volksgemeinschaft lives. They FEEL like home. They ARE colonies on stolen land.

### Character

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Vibe** | "Normal America." Suburbs, small towns, base towns. |
| **Economy** | Super-wages. Workers receive more than they produce. |
| **Policing** | Invisible. Police protect property, not occupy territory. |
| **Ideology** | "Common sense" liberalism (decaying into explicit fascism) |
| **Stability** | High. Conformity enforced socially, not violently. |

### Examples

**Manhattan, Kansas**
- Fort Riley adjacent (military-industrial)
- K-State university (ideology production)
- Small-town Main Street aesthetic
- Everyone knows everyone (social control)

**Suburban Development**
- White flight destination
- HOA governance (private conformity enforcement)
- Commute to extraction (work elsewhere, live here)
- "Good schools" (segregation by property value)

**Corporate Campus Town**
- Tech workers, professionals
- High wages, high isolation
- Diversity as branding, not solidarity
- "Apolitical" (deeply political)

### The Workers Are Hitlerites

This is not name-calling. It's structural analysis.

OGV workers are integrated into the settler-colonial project. Their wages depend on extraction from OPC and Frontier. Their housing is on stolen land. Their "safety" requires police occupation of OPC.

They don't have to consciously support fascism. **Their material interests align with it.**

When crisis comes (wages fall, instability rises), they have two options:
1. **Solidarity with the colonized** → Revolution (requires pre-built edges)
2. **Double down on Volksgemeinschaft** → Fascism (default path)

Without organizing, they choose fascism. Not because they're evil. Because it protects their position.

---

## Territory Type 2: OPC (Occupied Penal Colonies)

### The Internal Colonies

> "The purpose of OPC is the administration and control of labor. Human beings. People."

OPC territories exist to extract labor from colonized populations while containing their revolutionary potential.

### Character

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Vibe** | Ghettoes, barrios, trailer parks. Visible poverty. |
| **Economy** | Sub-wages. Workers produce more than they receive. |
| **Policing** | Occupying army. Police are colonial force. |
| **Ideology** | Survival. Resistance. (Poor whites: contested) |
| **Stability** | Low. High tension. Simmering always. |

### Examples

**Southside Chicago**
- Black internal colony
- Deindustrialized (jobs moved, people stayed)
- Hyper-policed (occupation)
- Hyper-incarcerated (labor extraction)
- Revolutionary history (Fred Hampton, Rainbow Coalition)

**East LA**
- Chicano barrio
- Immigrant labor reserve
- ICE raids (terror as control)
- Informal economy (survival)
- Resistance culture (muralism, organizing)

**Appalachian Hollow**
- Poor white extraction zone
- Coal country (resource + labor extraction)
- Opioid crisis (population control through addiction)
- Contested terrain (could go revolution OR fascism)
- History of militant labor (Blair Mountain)

**Trailer Park**
- Poor white margin
- Materially OPC (poverty, precarity, extraction)
- Ideologically contested (offered Volksgemeinschaft membership)
- Key battleground (who organizes them first?)

### The Penal Aspect

OPC isn't metaphor. It's literal.

- **13th Amendment loophole**: "Except as punishment for crime"
- **Mass incarceration**: 2+ million imprisoned, disproportionately Black/brown
- **Prison labor**: Pennies per hour, billions in value
- **Probation/parole**: 4+ million under supervision, limited organizing capacity
- **Police occupation**: Armed presence in colonized neighborhoods
- **Fines and fees**: Revenue extraction from poverty

The carceral state IS the administration of OPC. Every police station is a garrison. Every prison is a labor camp.

### The Poor White Question

Poor whites in OPC are the **bifurcation battleground**.

Material position: Same as colonized
- Low wages
- Precarity
- Extraction
- Neglect

Ideological position: Contested
- Offered "whiteness wage" by Volksgemeinschaft
- "You're not like THEM. You're one of US."
- Confederate flag as class suicide

The game mechanic: **Can you build solidarity edges to poor whites before the Volksgemeinschaft recruits them?**

Historical examples:
- **Success**: Rainbow Coalition, Share Croppers Union, IWW
- **Failure**: Bacon's Rebellion aftermath, Wallace voters, MAGA

---

## Territory Type 3: The Frontier

### The Ongoing Theft

> "These territories are extractive and represent control of the land."

The Frontier is where settler-colonialism is most visible as ONGOING. Not history. Present.

### Character

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Vibe** | Vast. Empty (not empty). "Wilderness." |
| **Economy** | Primary extraction. Oil, minerals, timber, water. |
| **Policing** | Federal/military. Private security. Not local cops. |
| **Ideology** | Indigenous: sovereignty, land back. Settlers: frontier myth. |
| **Stability** | Variable. Spikes during extraction events. |

### Examples

**Standing Rock / DAPL**
- Reservation (Lakota sovereignty)
- Pipeline (extraction infrastructure)
- Water protectors (resistance)
- National Guard (colonial military response)
- Global attention (solidarity networks)

**Bakken Oil Fields**
- Extraction zone
- Man camps (violence, trafficking)
- Environmental destruction (flaring, spills)
- Boom-bust economics (disposable labor)

**Navajo Nation**
- Reservation (Diné sovereignty)
- Uranium mining legacy (cancer, contamination)
- Coal extraction (Peabody)
- Water scarcity (extraction priority over people)

**Great Plains Agricultural**
- Industrial farming (monoculture)
- Aquifer depletion (Ogallala)
- Immigrant labor (OPC people working Frontier extraction)
- Climate vulnerability

### Reservation as Subtype

Indigenous reservations are special:

| Aspect | Standard Frontier | Reservation |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Sovereignty | None (federal land) | Nominal (treaty rights) |
| Resistance | Environmental | Sovereignty + environmental |
| Extraction | Uncontested | Contested (legal + direct action) |
| Solidarity | Limited | High (shared colonization with OPC) |

**Special mechanics:**
- Land Back actions (reduce Volksgemeinschaft control)
- Treaty rights assertions (legal terrain)
- Water protector camps (direct action)
- Indigenous-Black solidarity (shared colonization)

### The Land as Dead Matter

The Frontier encodes a **ontological violence**: treating land as commodity.

Indigenous ontology: Land is relation. Reciprocity. Living.
Settler ontology: Land is property. Extraction. Dead matter.

The game should reflect this. Frontier extraction has **consequences**:
- Environmental degradation
- Climate effects
- Water scarcity
- Long-term territory damage

You can't just extract forever. The land fights back.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The formula:

```
Φ = (V_opc - W_opc) + (V_frontier - W_frontier)

W_ogv = V_ogv + Φ
```

OGV wages EXCEED local value production because they receive the surplus extracted from OPC and Frontier.

This is why OGV workers defend the system. Their material interests are real.

## The Game Timeline: Protracted People's War

The game follows **Mao Zedong's Protracted People's War** framework from "On Protracted War" (May 1938):

| Phase | Name | Game Name | Duration |
|-------|------|-----------|----------|
| **Pre** | Coalescence | Decaying Liberalism | 4 years |
| **—** | *The Purge* | *Test of Coalescence* | *Event* |
| **1** | Strategic Defensive | Resistance (Early) | Indefinite |
| **2** | Strategic Stalemate | Resistance (Pivotal) | Indefinite |
| **3** | Strategic Counter-Offensive | The Offensive | Until victory |

**CRITICAL: The phases are FLUID, not linear.** Transitions are bidirectional:

```
DEFENSIVE <------> EQUILIBRIUM <------> OFFENSIVE
    |                   ^                   |
    +-------------------+-------------------+
                        |
                        v
                   DESTRUCTION
```

- A successful enemy counteroffensive pushes you back
- A premature offensive that fails drops you to equilibrium
- The Long March (1934-35) was a retreat from failed offensive to defensive
- Conditions determine phase, not time

### Key Insight from Mao

> "Whether China becomes an independent country or is reduced to a colony will be determined not by the retention or loss of the big cities in the first stage but by the extent to which the whole nation exerts itself in the second."

Translation for our game: **Stage 2 (Stalemate) is the pivotal one.** Not the dramatic pre-stage coalescence, not the glorious Stage 3 offensive—the grinding, patient, "most trying" period of building strength from weakness.

---

### Pre-Stage: Coalescence (Years 0-4)

Before we can fight a protracted war, we must **become a movement**.

The game begins in the **Weimar moment**. The player starts with:
- Scattered local organizers
- Isolated affinity groups
- Community organizations
- Study circles
- No coherent revolutionary force

These disparate entities must COALESCE into a movement capable of surviving what's coming.

Liberalism is not a faction. It's the **water everyone is swimming in**:
- "Law and order" = police occupation of OPC
- "Meritocracy" = justification of extraction
- "Colorblindness" = denial of settler-colonialism
- "Property rights" = defense of stolen land
- "Both sides" = false equivalence enabling fascism

**Key insight**: Liberalism IS implicit fascism. The game makes this explicit by showing what liberalism enables.

**Player goal**: Build solidarity edges between isolated groups. Develop shared analysis. Create infrastructure. Establish base areas. **Coalesce into a movement.**

---

### The Purge: Test of Coalescence (Year 4)

At the end of Year 4, **The Purge** happens. This is not optional. This is not preventable. The Volksgemeinschaft consolidates. The mask comes off.

The Purge answers the question:

> **"Have we progressed from a scattered amalgamation of disparate entities into a coherent enough movement to begin the Defensive phase?"**

**The Purge targets:**
- Revolutionary organizers (arrests, disappearances)
- Solidarity networks (edges attacked)
- OPC resistance infrastructure (raids, destruction)
- Frontier resistance camps (military assault)

**What determines survival (coherence):**
- Solidarity edge density (are groups connected?)
- Organization strength (can they coordinate?)
- Infrastructure (can they survive underground?)
- Geographic dispersion (not all eggs in one basket)

**Outcomes:**
- **YES (Coherent)** → Enter Stage 1 (Strategic Defensive) as a real movement
- **NO (Scattered)** → Game Over. Scattered groups destroyed individually.

The Purge is the **test of coalescence**. It marks the transition from pre-stage to Stage 1.

---

### Stage 1: Strategic Defensive (Post-Purge)

We survived The Purge. We are now a **coherent movement**.

From Mao: *"In this stage, in spite of considerable losses, China will make considerable progress, which will become the main basis for her continued resistance in the second stage."*

The enemy (fascism) is on the offensive. They control the state. We are on the strategic defensive—but we are a **real force now**.

**The reality:**
- OGV: Fully mobilized Volksgemeinschaft (explicit fascism)
- OPC: Under occupation, but resistance is organized
- Frontier: Extraction + repression, but Indigenous resistance persists
- Your organization: Coherent, fighting defensively

**Warfare form**: Guerrilla warfare. Base areas defended. Underground resistance. The enemy attacks; we absorb and counterattack locally.

**Player goal**: Survive enemy offensives. Defend and expand base areas. Reach stalemate.

**Transition to Stage 2**: When the enemy's offensive capacity is exhausted and neither side can decisively defeat the other, the war enters Stage 2 (Stalemate).

---

### Stage 2: Strategic Stalemate

Neither side can win. The war becomes a grinding test of endurance.

From Mao: *"This second stage will be the transitional stage of the entire war; it will be the most trying period but also the pivotal one... If we can persevere... China will in that stage gain the power to change from weakness to strength."*

The enemy has exhausted their offensive capacity. They control the state, but **cannot destroy the resistance**. We have defended our base areas, but **cannot yet challenge state power**.

**The reality:**
- OGV: Consolidated Volksgemeinschaft, but cracks appearing
- OPC: Heavy repression, but resistance entrenched
- Frontier: Extraction continues, but cannot eliminate Indigenous resistance
- Your organization: Battle-tested, growing despite losses

**Warfare form**: Primarily guerrilla warfare, supplemented by mobile warfare

**Player goal**: Persevere. Build strength from weakness. Wait for contradictions to sharpen.

**Key dynamics of Stage 2:**
- Enemy's internal contradictions deepen (can't maintain super-wages forever)
- Resistance networks grow despite repression
- International solidarity strengthens
- War-weariness in enemy ranks

**Why this stage is pivotal:**
- Not the dramatic coalescence (pre-stage)
- Not the triumphant offensive (Stage 3)
- The grinding, patient work of building power
- This is where "weakness changes to strength"

Historical parallels:
- The Long March—CPC survived to fight another day
- French Resistance—maintained pressure until liberation
- Underground Railroad—sustained network under total repression
- ANC in apartheid South Africa—decades of patient building

---

### Stage 3: Strategic Counter-Offensive

When conditions are right, the game offers the option to **go on the offensive**.

From Mao: *"The third stage will be the stage of the counter-offensive to recover our lost territories... Our war will no longer be one of strategic defensive, but will turn into a strategic counter-offensive."*

**Requirements to enter Stage 3:**
- Organization strength above threshold
- Solidarity edge density above threshold
- Enemy contradictions sharpened (super-wages falling, legitimacy crisis)
- (Optional bonus) International conditions favorable

**The counter-offensive reality:**
- OGV: Cracking, mass defection possible
- OPC: Liberated zones established
- Frontier: Land Back movements succeed
- Resistance: Open organization, armed struggle

**Warfare form**: Mobile warfare primary, positional warfare rises to importance

**Player goal**: Recover lost territory. Destroy the enemy. **Victory.**

**Risks:**
- **Too early**: Offensive crushed, back to Stage 2 (weakened)
- **Too late**: Slow Death (enemy consolidates too strongly)

---

### Victory State: Revolution

Victory is achieved at the **end of Stage 3**.

From Mao: *"Not until we fight our way to the Yalu River can this war be considered over."*

The settler-colonial project is overthrown. The Volksgemeinschaft is dissolved. A new society begins.

Victory requires completing the **full arc**:
1. Stage 1: Build base areas, survive The Purge
2. Stage 2: Persevere in stalemate, build strength from weakness
3. Stage 3: Go on the offensive, recover lost territory

---

### Failure States

| Failure | When | Cause |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Crushed in The Purge** | End of Stage 1 | Base areas insufficient |
| **Destroyed in Stalemate** | During Stage 2 | Resistance hunted to extinction |
| **Defeated in Counter-Offensive** | During Stage 3 | Offensive fails, enemy rallies |
| **Slow Death** | Stage 2 (prolonged) | Organization stagnates, eventually destroyed |

## Gameplay Implications

### Territory Control

Each territory has a **dominant faction**:
- OGV: Volksgemeinschaft (always)
- OPC: Contested (colonized resistance vs. state)
- Frontier: Contested (Indigenous sovereignty vs. extraction)

Player actions shift control. Revolutionary player organizes in OPC/Frontier, builds solidarity edges, prepares for crisis.

### Solidarity Mechanics

| Edge Type | Difficulty | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| OPC ↔ OPC | Easy | Shared exploitation |
| OPC ↔ Frontier | Medium | Shared colonization, geographic distance |
| OGV ↔ OPC | Hard | Material interests oppose |
| OGV ↔ OGV | N/A | Atomized, no solidarity needed |

Building edges costs resources (organizer time, risk). Edges decay without maintenance.

### The Poor White Mechanic

Poor whites in OPC are a **timed resource**.

Each tick, there's a chance the Volksgemeinschaft recruits them (especially during crisis). If you've built solidarity edges first, they resist recruitment.

This creates urgency: organize poor whites BEFORE the crisis peaks, or lose them to fascism.

### Extraction Events

Frontier territories generate **extraction events**:
- Pipeline construction (high heat, resistance opportunity)
- Mining expansion (resource gain, environmental damage)
- Water rights conflicts (Indigenous resistance trigger)

These events can be:
- Exploited (gain resources, increase extraction)
- Resisted (reduce extraction, build solidarity)
- Ignored (default continues)

---

## Aesthetic Notes

### OGV Aesthetic
- Clean, orderly, "normal"
- Flags, lawns, churches
- Invisible violence (it's elsewhere)
- Soundtrack: Americana, country, Christian rock (ironic)

### OPC Aesthetic
- Visible decay, visible life
- Murals, graffiti, resistance culture
- Visible policing (occupation)
- Soundtrack: Hip-hop, punk, corridos, gospel

### Frontier Aesthetic
- Vast, sparse, industrial scarring
- Indigenous presence (not "empty")
- Extraction infrastructure (pipelines, rigs, mines)
- Soundtrack: Ambient, Indigenous music, industrial

---

## Historical Inflection Point: July 20, 1932

The Prussian Coup (Preussenschlag) is the moment when the German left was materially capable of stopping fascism and chose not to. **The SPD—not the KPD—bears responsibility.**

### What the SPD Controlled

- **Prussia**: 2/3 of German territory
- **The police apparatus**
- **The Reichsbanner**: ~1 million armed workers
- **Legal authority**

### What Happened

Papen launched an unconstitutional coup. The SPD could have:
- Called a general strike
- Mobilized the Reichsbanner
- Used Prussian police against the coup
- Arrested the conspirators

**What did they do?** Surrendered without a fight. Filed a lawsuit.

### Dimitrov's Assessment (1935)

> "Fascism was able to come to power primarily because the working class, owing to the policy of class collaboration with the bourgeoisie pursued by the Social-Democratic leaders, proved to be split, politically and organizationally disarmed."

> "This is the way in which the Social-Democrats, by disorganizing and splitting the ranks of the working class, cleared the path to power for fascism."

### SPD Betrayals

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1919 | Murdered Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, Spartacists |
| 1919-1933 | Consistent class collaboration with bourgeoisie |
| 1929 | Banned Red Front Fighters while SA remained legal |
| **July 20, 1932** | **Surrendered Prussia without a fight** |
| May 1933 | SPD deputies voted FOR Hitler's foreign policy |

### Lesson for the Game

**Material capability + political will = resistance**
**Material capability - political will = betrayal** (SPD)
**Political will - material capability = martyrdom** (KPD)

The Purge tests whether the player's movement has BOTH capability AND will.
