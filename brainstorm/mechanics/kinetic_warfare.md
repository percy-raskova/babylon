# Kinetic Warfare: The Asymmetric Logistics Engine

## Core Philosophy
We are not modeling frontlines (Hearts of Iron). We are modeling **System Disruption** and **Insurgency**.
Combat occurs on the **Layer 0 Spatial Graph** (Nodes and Edges).

## The Target Triad

### 1. Nodes of Extraction (The "Oil Rigs")
- **Examples:** Industrial farms, mines, logistics hubs.
- **Function:** Source of Imperial Value.
- **Vulnerability:** Low defense, high labor density.
- **Tactic:** Strikes, Seizure, Sabotage.
- **Goal:** Starve the State of resources.

### 2. Edges of Circulation (The "Arteries")
- **Examples:** Power lines, Fiber cables, Highways.
- **Function:** Logistics and Information flow.
- **Mechanic: Social Blowback.**
    - These are dual-use (Civilian/Military).
    - **Blind Attack:** High collateral damage -> Lowers Pop Consciousness (Alienation).
    - **Surgical Attack:** Requires high Intelligence/Recon -> Hurts State only -> Raises Consciousness.

### 3. Nodes of Realization (The "Engines")
- **Examples:** Data centers, Arms factories, Command bunkers.
- **Function:** State security and high-tech production.
- **Mechanic: The Reaction Force (QRF).**
    - High Security rating.
    - Attacking prematurely triggers "Elite Response" (SWAT/Delta) -> Total Party Kill for the player's unit.
    - Requires: High Cadre discipline + Diversionary operations.

## The Gameplay Loop
1.  **Reconnaissance:** Spending resources to reveal the hidden attributes of Map Nodes (Defense, Connectivity, Collateral Risk).
2.  **Preparation:** Cultivating sympathy in the local population (Human Shield effect).
3.  **Strike:** The tactical resolution (Auto-resolved based on Force correlations).
4.  **Fallout:** Calculating the shift in Consciousness and State Repression based on the outcome.

## Integration Note
This builds upon the "Layer 0" Spatial Graph.
