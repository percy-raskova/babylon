# Layer 0: The Territorial Substrate & Subversive Tenancy

## Core Philosophy
- **Land vs. Value:** Value is infinite (labor); Land is finite (zero-sum).
- **Legibility over Stealth:** The State knows where you are (public records). The game is not about *hiding*, but about *staying below the threshold of repression*.

## Topology: Strategic Sectors
- **Granularity:** "Strategic Sectors" (e.g., University District, Docks, Luxury Housing).
- **Connectivity:** Adjacency graph determines logistics and "spillover" of unrest.

## Ownership Model: The Host/Parasite Stack
Every node has a layered tenure system:
1.  **Legal Sovereign (The Host):** Recognized by State. Collects Rent/Taxes.
2.  **De Facto Occupant (The Parasite):** The actual user of the space.

## The Mechanic: Operational Profile (The Stance System)
We explicitly reject "spending resources on deception." Instead, the player manages their **Profile**.

### 1. Low Profile (Opaque)
- **Stance:** "We are just a reading group/community center."
- **Behavior:** Omitting the full truth. No active lying, just boring legality.
- **State Logic:** The State sees you but ignores you.
  - *Cost to State:* Low but non-zero (Paperwork check).
  - *Action:* No eviction.
- **Player Trade-off:** - **Pros:** Safe from eviction.
  - **Cons:** Low Recruitment (Low Clarity/Alignment generation).

### 2. High Profile (Transparent)
- **Stance:** "We are a Revolutionary Cell."
- **Behavior:** Open declaration of aims.
- **State Logic:** You are now a priority target.
  - *Cost to State:* Zero (You admitted it).
  - *Action:* Eviction/Siege clock starts ticking.
- **Player Trade-off:**
  - **Pros:** High Recruitment (High Clarity attracts Cadre).
  - **Cons:** High Heat. Must defend the territory physically.

## The Eviction Pipeline (Gentrification as Weapon)
- If a Sector becomes unstable or High Profile, the Ruling Class initiates "Redevelopment."
- **Mechanism:** Economic displacement, not always military force.
- **Result:** Rents spike -> Poor populations (Sympathizers) are forced to migrate -> The revolutionary cell loses its human shield.

## Integration Strategy
- **Phase 3.5:** Implement the `Territory` node structure.
- **Phase 4:** Link `Profile` to the `Consciousness Vector` (Clarity).
