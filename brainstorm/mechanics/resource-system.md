# Resource System: Labor-Power and Coherence

## The Core Insight

Every game needs two fundamental resources:

1. **Mana** - What you CAN do (capacity to act)
2. **Hit Points** - What you ARE (capacity to exist)

In Babylon, these map to Marxist categories:

| Game Concept | Marxist Category | Meaning |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| **Mana** | Labor-Power | The capacity to work, to act, to organize |
| **HP** | Inverted Entropy | Coherence, order, organization |

---

## Resource 1: Labor-Power (LP)

### Definition

Labor-power is the fundamental source of all value (Marx). In game terms, it's the **capacity to take actions**.

Every action costs labor-power:
- Organizing workers
- Building infrastructure
- Agitating
- Moving resources
- Establishing communication
- Training cadre

### Generation

Where does labor-power come from?

| Source | Mechanism | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Organized workers | Base LP per organized node | More workers = more capacity |
| Solidarity edges | Bonus LP from connected networks | Unity multiplies capacity |
| Territory control | LP from controlled base areas | Material base matters |
| Reproductive labor | LP spent to generate future LP | Training, care work, maintenance |

### Consumption

What spends labor-power?

| Action Category | LP Cost | Notes |
|-----------------|---------|-------|
| **Organizing** | Medium | Converting unorganized to organized |
| **Agitating** | Low | Raising consciousness, spreading ideas |
| **Building** | High | Infrastructure, safe houses, communication |
| **Moving** | Variable | Distance and risk dependent |
| **Fighting** | Very High | Direct confrontation with state |
| **Maintenance** | Constant | Keeping existing organization alive |

### The Maintenance Tax

**Critical insight**: Organization requires constant labor to maintain.

Without ongoing investment:
- Networks decay
- Solidarity edges weaken
- Trained cadre drift away
- Infrastructure degrades

This is the "housework" of revolution. It's invisible but essential.

## Resource 2: Coherence (Inverted Entropy)

### Definition

Coherence measures how much the movement acts as **one body** vs. **scattered individuals**.

- High coherence = unified, coordinated, can act strategically
- Low coherence = fragmented, confused, picked off individually

**HP is not "health"** - it's organizational integrity.

### The Entropy Equation

Entropy **naturally increases** over time. This is thermodynamics AND social reality:

- People drift apart
- Disagreements fester
- Communication degrades
- Memory fades
- New members don't know history

**Coherence requires constant work to maintain.**

### What INCREASES Entropy (Decreases Coherence)?

| Factor | Mechanism | Game Effect |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Time** | Natural drift | Slow constant drain |
| **Distance** | Geographic separation | Edges across territory cost more |
| **Repression** | State attacks networks | Targeted coherence damage |
| **Ideological drift** | Political disagreements | Internal fragmentation |
| **Growth** | New members dilute culture | Scaling problem |
| **Success** | Different visions emerge | "What do we do now?" |
| **Failure** | Demoralization, blame | Recrimination spiral |

### What DECREASES Entropy (Increases Coherence)?

| Factor | Mechanism | Game Effect |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Shared struggle** | Common enemy unifies | Crisis can build coherence |
| **Communication** | Regular contact | Infrastructure investment |
| **Shared analysis** | Political education | Study circles, theory |
| **Democratic process** | Legitimate decisions | People follow what they decide |
| **Victories** | Proof of concept | "This works!" |
| **Rituals** | Shared practices | Culture building |
| **History** | Collective memory | "Remember when we..." |

## The Dialectic

```
LABOR-POWER: What you CAN do
COHERENCE:   What you ARE

                    HIGH COHERENCE
                          |
                          |
    SECTARIANISM ----+----+----+ REVOLUTIONARY
    (unified but     |         | POTENTIAL
     impotent)       |         | (can act as one)
                     |         |
    LOW LP ----------+---------+---------- HIGH LP
                     |         |
    ATOMIZATION -----+----+----+ ULTRA-LEFTISM
    (scattered,      |         | (lots of activity,
     powerless)      |         |  no coordination)
                          |
                          |
                    LOW COHERENCE
```

### The Four Quadrants

**High LP, High Coherence**: Revolutionary potential. Can act decisively as unified force.

**High LP, Low Coherence**: Ultra-leftism. Lots of activity but uncoordinated. Actions cancel out or work at cross-purposes. "Movement of movements" without movement.

**Low LP, High Coherence**: Sectarianism. Small, tight group. Agrees on everything. Can't do anything. "The revolutionary party of 12 people."

**Low LP, Low Coherence**: Atomization. The starting condition. Also the death state. Scattered individuals with no capacity to act together.

## Phase Interactions

How do resources interact with the Protracted People's War phases?

### Coalescence (Pre-Stage)

- **Primary challenge**: Building coherence from atomization
- **LP**: Low (few organized workers)
- **Coherence**: Must rise or The Purge destroys you
- **Key mechanic**: Every solidarity edge increases coherence

### The Purge

- **The test**: Do you have enough coherence to survive?
- **Entropy bomb**: Massive coherence damage
- **Survival threshold**: Coherence must exceed Purge damage
- **Failure**: Movement dissolves back to atomization (Game Over)

### Strategic Defensive (Stage 1)

- **Primary challenge**: Surviving while building LP
- **Coherence**: Under constant attack (repression)
- **LP**: Must grow despite losses
- **Key mechanic**: Every base area provides LP + coherence bonus

### Strategic Stalemate (Stage 2)

- **Primary challenge**: The long grind
- **Coherence**: Maintaining unity during "most trying" period
- **LP**: Building capacity without overextending
- **Key mechanic**: Patience. Don't spend LP faster than you generate it.

### Strategic Offensive (Stage 3)

- **Primary challenge**: Can you spend LP faster than enemy can respond?
- **Coherence**: Unity under pressure of success
- **LP**: Massive expenditure for victory
- **Key mechanic**: Timing. Too early = crushed. Too late = enemy consolidates.

## Mechanical Questions (To Resolve)

### LP Questions

1. **Regeneration rate**: Per turn? Per organized worker? Modified by what?
2. **Storage cap**: Can you stockpile LP? Or use-it-or-lose-it?
3. **Transfer**: Can LP flow through solidarity edges?
4. **Specialization**: Different LP types (organizing LP vs fighting LP)?

### Coherence Questions

1. **Measurement**: Global? Per network? Per territory?
2. **Visibility**: Can player see exact number? Or only indicators?
3. **Recovery**: How fast can coherence be rebuilt after damage?
4. **Thresholds**: At what coherence level do bad things happen?

### Interaction Questions

1. **LP/Coherence tradeoff**: Does spending LP cost coherence? (Action fatigues unity?)
2. **Coherence/LP multiplier**: Does coherence multiply LP effectiveness?
3. **Death spiral**: Low coherence -> less LP -> can't rebuild coherence -> death?
4. **Virtuous cycle**: High coherence -> more LP -> easier to maintain coherence -> growth?

## Historical Examples

### Paris Commune (1871)

- **High LP, Low Coherence**: Workers seized the city
- Fragmented politically (Blanquists, Proudhonists, Marxists)
- Could not coordinate defense
- Crushed in 10 weeks

### Bolshevik Party (1917)

- **High Coherence, Variable LP**: Tight organization
- Could act decisively when moments arrived
- "Professional revolutionaries" = coherence investment
- LP surged during dual power period

### German KPD (1919-1933)

- **High LP, Medium Coherence**: Mass party
- Periodic ultra-left errors (1921, 1923)
- Coherence undermined by SPD collaboration with bourgeoisie
- LP destroyed by Nazi repression

### Black Panther Party (1966-1982)

- **Built coherence through**: 10-point program, uniform, discipline, survival programs
- **LP from**: Community organizing, mutual aid
- **Destroyed by**: COINTELPRO (targeted coherence attacks)
- Lesson: State understands coherence matters

## Design Principles

1. **Both resources are necessary**: Can't win with just one
2. **Both decay without investment**: Maintenance is gameplay
3. **Crisis tests both**: Shocks reveal weaknesses
4. **Growth creates tension**: Scaling is hard
5. **Enemy targets both**: Repression attacks LP (arrests) AND coherence (infiltration, disinformation)

---

## Open Questions

- How does this interact with the existing solidarity edge system?
- Should coherence be local (per network) or global (whole movement)?
- What's the UI representation? (Resource bars? Gauges? Emergent from graph state?)
- How does this connect to the territory system (OGV/OPC/Frontier)?
