# Vanguard Efficiency Equation: The Resource Economy

## Core Concept
Moves away from generic "mana" to a materialist simulation of **Organization (Cadre)** vs. **Movement (Sympathizers)**.

## The Resources
1. **Cadre Labor (CL)**:
   - Deterministic, high-value AP.
   - Source: Slow cultivation/training.
   - Reliability: Near 100%.
   - Usage: Structural actions (Logistics, Theory, Cell building).
2. **Sympathizer Labor (SL)**:
   - Stochastic, mass volume.
   - Source: Crisis conditions + Reputation.
   - Reliability: Fluctuates based on Consciousness.
   - Usage: Mass actions (Protests, Riots, Voting).
3. **Reputation**:
   - The Multiplier/Magnet. Increases volume of SL but not quality.

## The Mechanic: Coherence
The efficiency of the movement is defined by the "Transmission Belt" capacity of the Cadre.

**Formula:** Effective Output = (Sympathizer Labor * Reputation) * Coherence Factor

**Coherence Factor**: Derived from the ratio of Cadre to Sympathizers.
- *High Rep / Low Cadre* = Low Coherence (Movement becomes muddled, prone to opportunism/adventurism).
- *Balanced Ratio* = High Coherence (Precision strikes).

## Player Trap
The "Influencer Trap": Farming Reputation is faster than training Cadre. A player who optimizes for Rep will face a historical rupture (crisis) with a massive but uncontrollable mob that fails to execute strategic goals.
