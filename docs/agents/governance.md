# Governance and Git

Babylon is an entertainment-first emergent political-economy game. Babylon is
not a forecast and not a scientific reproduction. Theory constrains the causal model but
does not predetermine results.

Determinism proves computational identity, not scientific truth. Historical
cases test causal signatures and counterfactual behavior. The Bevy client is an
administrative viewer with no player action.

The three executable gates are:

<!-- Vale: the next item is a governed gate name. -->
<!-- vale Vale.Terms = NO -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO -->
1. **PostgreSQL/H3/Archive decision-loop slice**
<!-- vale Vale.Terms = YES -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES -->
<!-- Vale: the next item is a governed gate name. -->
<!-- vale ste.NounClusters = NO -->
2. **COVID E0 emergence proof**
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES -->
<!-- Vale: the next item is a governed gate name. -->
3. **Player agency**
<!-- vale ste.NounClusters = YES -->

Read [`CONSTITUTION.md`](../../CONSTITUTION.md) v4.0.0 for the law. Read

[`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](../../CONTRIBUTORS.md) for the full merge rules.

## Control surfaces

<!-- Vale: the next paragraphs preserve exact Linear fields, work-item IDs,
     GitHub Project names, and pull-request field names from the contract. -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO -->
<!-- vale ste.NounClusters = NO -->
<!-- vale ste.Dictionary = NO -->
In Linear, use
**[Babylon v1 — Playable Political Economy](https://linear.app/percy-raskova/project/babylon-v1-playable-political-economy-299b037e7feb)**
and its charter as the current control surface. Start with
[PER-5](https://linear.app/percy-raskova/issue/PER-5/constitution-v4-and-linear-portfolio-cutover).
Use
[PER-15](https://linear.app/percy-raskova/issue/PER-15/migrate-canonical-issue-governance-from-github-to-linear)
for the migration status.

Linear alone is canonical for issue identity, scope, status, priority,
dependencies, horizon, milestones, schedule, and current work. GitHub supplies
source control, pull requests, reviews, and historical evidence.

The team closed GitHub Project #7 and Project #8. They are historical inputs.
The migration is complete, and PER-15 is complete. Both projects remain
recoverable evidence. Neither supplies current fields, views, estimates, or
status.

PER-2 records the accepted delivery automation. Each pull-request description
must link its canonical Linear issue and select exactly one delivery
disposition. Use `Part of PER-N` as a non-closing reference for a partial
delivery. Use `Fixes PER-N` as a closing reference only on the final delivery
that satisfies the issue.

A multi-pull-request issue must remain open after every partial merge. Draft
and review activity keep the linked issue in progress. Only the merged closing
reference completes it. The automation does not require GitHub Project fields.
Imported historical issue sync cannot override canonical Linear project
scope, hierarchy, horizon, milestone, or priority.
<!-- vale ste.Dictionary = YES -->
<!-- vale ste.NounClusters = YES -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES -->

## Authority

Babylon uses Agentic Engineering. The human Director controls the reserved
theory line and merges releases to `main`. Gates grant agent autonomy.

A green gate grants a merge license. A red gate means stop. Report the fault
before you continue.

Stop and ask the Director when a task needs one of these changes:

- a new mathematical primitive
- a weaker prohibition
- a change to the reserved theory line

Use the content vocabulary ceremony for new governed terms.

## Git workflow

For a regular change, create each lane from `dev`. Open the PR against `dev`. Do not
commit directly to `dev` or `main`.

Use one of these prefixes for a lane:

- `feature/`
- `fix/`
- `docs/`
- `refactor/`
- `test/`

<!-- Vale: this paragraph preserves literal branch and issue identifiers. -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO -->
Codex-managed work can use `codex/`, with a PER identity such as
`codex/PER-123-short-name`. Other lanes can also include `PER-123` when that
makes the manual Linear link clear.
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES -->

Use `type(scope): description` for each commit line. Keep one logical unit in
each commit. Use `mise run commit` so the local hooks can check staged content.

<!-- Vale: this paragraph preserves literal Git emergency-workflow terms. -->
<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO -->
Only the Director merges to `main`. The two allowed sources are a release PR
from `dev`, or a critical hotfix PR from `fix/*` that branches from `main` and
goes directly to `main`. Every merged hotfix needs a mandatory backport PR to
`dev`.
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES -->
<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->

<!-- Vale: this procedure preserves literal GitHub workflow and branch terms. -->
<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO -->
Retrieve the protected branches. Before qualification, prove that `dev` already
contains the previous protected `main` merge:

```bash
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main origin/dev
```

Prove the merged qualification workflow on that exact `dev` head:

```bash
gh workflow run main.yml --ref dev
```

The main PR must produce the complete combined manifest. It reruns ordinary CI
and adds uniquely named release-only qualification checks. After exact-head
acceptance, only the Director runs:

```bash
mise run pr:merge -- N --director-main
```

After the merge, the owner publishes the version from exact `origin/main` with
this enforced return path:

```bash
mise run release:prepare-dev-sync -- vX.Y.Z N
mise run release:tag -- --yes
```

Run the first command on a sanctioned lane created at exact `origin/main`.
Commit its real-diff lineage record, open its PR to `dev`, and merge it with the
ordinary sanctioned command. The tag task refuses until that PR makes exact
`origin/main` reachable from `origin/dev`.

A critical hotfix uses the same combined manifest and command, followed by its
mandatory backport PR to `dev`.

Use the merge rules in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` for all other pull requests.

<!-- Vale: this section preserves literal GitHub review and branch terms. -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO -->
## PR acceptance

The merge record identifies the base branch and exact reviewed head SHA. All
reported checks must complete successfully against that exact reviewed head
SHA and base branch.

The Copilot review must complete against the reviewed head. Each accepted
comment needs a fix. Every comment needs a reply. The final record marks all
Copilot review threads resolved.

Each PR records a behavioral-contract disposition. Changed behavior links a
durable, implementation-independent contract. No behavior change includes an
explanation of why the current contracts are enough.

Each PR also records its baseline disposition. An intentional governed
baseline change includes the declared ceremony, the record from
`tools/generate_ceremony_message.py`, and the required
`Baselines: blessed(<slug>)` trailer. Unintended drift is a fault, not a
ceremony.

The sole merge command is:

```bash
mise run pr:merge -- N
```

Do not run `gh pr merge` directly in any form. Preserve the source branch by
default. Branch deletion requires an explicit owner decision and verification
that no open PR or other work depends on the branch.
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES -->

## Scope and records

Read `ai/decisions/index.yaml` for recorded architecture decisions.
<!-- Vale: this paragraph preserves exact authority and repository path terms. -->
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO -->
`ai/state.yaml` is historical implementation evidence, not current status.
The `project/` tree is non-live context. Linear alone owns current status and
work.
<!-- vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES -->

Do not change an unrelated fault. Report it unless the task owner expands the
scope.

Add an ADR when the team makes an architecture decision. Keep old ADRs
unchanged because they record the rationale for an earlier choice.

Do not claim that planned behavior exists. Check the source and its executable
test before you change a live status claim.
