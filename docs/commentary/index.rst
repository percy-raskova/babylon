Commentary
==========

Meta-level documentation covering design philosophy, theoretical foundations,
and the development narrative behind Babylon: The Fall of America.

This section sits outside the standard Diataxis quadrants. Where tutorials
teach *how to do*, and concepts explain *why things work*, commentary
explores *why we built it this way*.

.. epigraph::

   The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways.
   The point, however, is to change it.

   -- Karl Marx, *Theses on Feuerbach* (1845)

Design Philosophy
-----------------

:doc:`design-philosophy` documents the architectural principles and coding
standards that shape the codebase. Topics include:

- The Embedded Trinity (Ledger, Topology, Archive)
- Data-driven design via the Paradox Pattern
- Why AI observes but never controls
- Test-driven development and type safety

Theoretical Foundations
-----------------------

:doc:`theoretical-foundations` explains the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Third
Worldist (MLM-TW) theory encoded in the simulation. Topics include:

- The fundamental theorem of imperialism
- Consciousness dynamics as differential equations
- Survival calculus and rational choice
- The George Jackson bifurcation

For Developers
--------------

This commentary provides context that doesn't fit in how-to guides or
reference documentation:

- **Why** certain architectural decisions were made
- **Historical context** behind game mechanics
- **Theoretical justifications** for formula choices

Use this section when you need to understand the reasoning behind the
code, not just how to use it.
