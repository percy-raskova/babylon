Commentary
==========

Meta-level documentation covering design philosophy, theoretical foundations,
and the development narrative behind Babylon: The Fall of America.

This section sits outside the standard Diataxis quadrants. Where tutorials
teach *how to do*, and concepts explain *why things work*, commentary
explores *why we built it this way*.

.. epigraph::

   The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways.
   The point, however, is to change it.

   -- Karl Marx, *Theses on Feuerbach* (1845)

**Design Philosophy** (:doc:`design-philosophy`) documents the architectural
principles and coding standards that shape the codebase: the Embedded Trinity,
data-driven design via the Paradox Pattern, why AI observes but never controls,
and test-driven development.

**Theoretical Foundations** (:doc:`theoretical-foundations`) explains the
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Third Worldist (MLM-TW) theory encoded in the
simulation: the fundamental theorem of imperialism, consciousness dynamics,
survival calculus, and the George Jackson bifurcation.

This commentary provides context that doesn't fit in how-to guides or
reference documentation—the *why* behind architectural decisions, historical
context behind mechanics, and theoretical justifications for formula choices.
