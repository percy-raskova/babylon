Architecture Boundary
=====================

``CONSTITUTION.md`` v4.1.0 governs the architecture. ``NORTH_STAR.md`` gives
the game direction and gate order. This page describes the live boundary after
the one-way PostgreSQL authority cutover.

System Boundary
---------------

Babylon has these primary boundaries:

#. A pure Rust engine judges one weekly tick.
#. Live Rust BSL rules control causal changes and finite material kernels.
#. Recognizers and events remain deterministic.
#. Executable shocks and player actions do not exist yet.
#. ``babylon-persistence`` owns authoritative game-managed PostgreSQL schema,
   writes, restart, and durability.
#. The frozen Python engine remains a behavioral reference. Python also owns
   data, AI, document, external-API, optimization, and local SQLite periphery.
#. Bevy remains an administrative viewer with no player action.

Ordinary BSL rules derive and write world data through governed causal
operations. External shocks must not write downstream results directly.
AI can parse, retrieve, and narrate. AI does not judge a game rule.

Live Rust Path
--------------

The shipping engine path is:

``babylon-kernel``
   Deterministic types and contracts.

``babylon-graph``
   Native relations, hyperedges, and canonical hashes.

``babylon-bsl``
   The BSL lexer, parser, checker, typed finite-kernel analysis, exact
   forecasting, loader, and evaluator.

``babylon-tick``
   The weekly tick, replay identity, material state, and atomic publication.

``babylon-persistence``
   Rust-owned PostgreSQL activation, campaign foundation, checkpoint restart,
   typed semantic rows, commit markers, and Archive dirty receipts.

``babylon-client``
   The Bevy administrative viewer.

Each weekly tick runs on detached state and buffers its events. The tick becomes
observable only after all rule, hash, and persistence boundaries succeed.
``GraphStateHash`` identifies graph bytes only. ``NominalWorldHash`` also binds
completed time, allocator cursors, and the governed phase-schedule digest.
``TickContentHashV1`` binds the identified replay result.
``ReplayTickSession`` publishes ``TickContentHashV1`` atomically. Replay
identity and campaign durability identity are separate typed inputs.

A finite kernel distributes exact ``Mass`` over one enum-ordered family of
bounded material effect bundles. It consumes one replay-keyed integer ticket
draw and applies only the selected bundle. The choice produces a separate
``ChoiceReceiptV1`` even when the selected bundle changes no material state.
Deterministic mechanics are the one-outcome case. Events own no authored
probability. The language assumes no independence between choices.

Authoritative Persistence
-------------------------

``babylon-runtime`` is the sole production composition root. It activates the
Rust schema, creates or opens ``DurableReplayRuntimeV2``, advances a tick, and
commits ``PreparedCommittedTickV2`` as ``CommittedTickEnvelopeV2``. Callers
cannot submit a pre-judged report or construct a second writer authority.

The live reader and writer are V2-only after Amendment AJ activation. This
path has no V1 decoder, compatibility projection, adapter, or fallback. The
Director must approve deletion after an inventory of prior development data.
Source and the Lawvere archive are never cleanup targets.

The epoch 8/9 predecessor ledger is append-only historical cutover evidence:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 25 55

   * - Ordinal
     - State
     - Meaning
   * - 1
     - ``prepared`` at epoch 8
     - Additive Rust schema and reference preparation completed.
   * - 2
     - ``rust_active`` at epoch 9
     - Legacy Python-managed relations were migrated or proved empty and
       retired. This row is the predecessor for the V2 authority transition.

The active authority ledger is
``babylon_meta.committed_tick_v2_authority_ledger``. Its only legal history is
``Prepared`` at epoch 10 followed by ``Active`` at epoch 11. Both rows bind the
active V2 cutover contract and epoch 11 reader migration. The active row also
binds the prepared-row digest, and the prepared row binds the epoch 9
predecessor-row digest.

The epoch 11 ``Active`` row is the final activation statement before
``COMMIT``. Activation is forward-only and idempotent. Runtime authority
reacquisition requires the exact two-row V2 ledger and its bound contract,
reader migration, and predecessor digests. The epoch 9 ``rust_active`` row
alone cannot reopen the writer.

.. vale ste.UnapprovedWords = NO
.. vale ste.NounClusters = NO

The runtime owns three schemas:

``babylon_ref``
   Immutable geography, H3 cohorts, and exact reference artifacts.

``babylon_state``
   Campaign foundation, typed graph and material rows, events, checkpoints,
   ``tick_event_v2`` and ``tick_event_field_v2``,
   ``tick_choice_receipt_v1`` with ``tick_choice_receipt_branch_v1`` and
   ``tick_choice_receipt_carrier_element_v1`` children, the commit marker
   ``tick_commit``, and
   ``archive_dirty_receipt_v1``.

``babylon_meta``
   The authority ledger plus typed campaign and navigation metadata.

One marker-last transaction writes the complete typed tick estate. It writes
choice receipts and choice-linked event metadata before a required full
checkpoint and one Archive dirty receipt. It then writes the commit marker.

The runtime acknowledges the tick only after ``COMMIT`` or exact
ambiguous-commit reconciliation. Retry and restart must reproduce the same
Envelope V2 bytes. The marker records ``envelope_layout_version = 2``. The
V2-only reader refuses every other value.

.. vale ste.NounClusters = YES
.. vale ste.UnapprovedWords = YES

Restart loads the campaign foundation or latest complete full checkpoint, then
replays a contiguous marker tail. A delta checkpoint is never a restore root.
Missing, duplicate, out-of-order, or digest-mismatched sections refuse before
the runtime resumes.

H3 Reader Boundary
------------------

Epoch 7 captured and proved the legacy H3 reader parity corpus. Epoch 9 has no
Python game-state reader edge and no compatibility projection. Rust installs
the exact reference cohort and Michigan dynamic foundation, then reads typed
relations directly.

Frozen Python Reference and Periphery
-------------------------------------

PER-48 is decided. The one-way cutover is complete. Rust owns authoritative
game-managed Postgres. Python continues only in the roles declared below.

ADR172 froze the Python engine. Its scenarios, property tests, traces, and
goldens remain behavioral contracts until a Rust or language-neutral contract
replaces them. ``RuntimeDatabase`` remains a separate mutable SQLite reference
store. The in-memory optimization package remains design-analysis periphery.

Python has no game-managed PostgreSQL DDL, DML, writer credential, migration
runner, compatibility adapter, or fallback after activation. Retained data and
document tooling may use dedicated stores that cannot mutate the governed game
schemas.

Client and Archive Boundary
---------------------------

The Bevy client still reads an administrative world view and displays the
nominal world hash. It does not submit a player intent.

Each committed tick emits an Archive dirty receipt. ``sim:archive`` installs the
client-owned semantic schema or checks its marker and relations. The Rust
Archive store binds each receipt to an exact dirty batch, worker contract, and
ordered knowledge-grant snapshot with provenance. It applies knowledge grants
in SQL, renders pages with the pinned strict template, persists known
citations, and searches only material visible to the player. Later work adds
broader dossier producers, the player-facing retrieval surface, and a player
decision loop that supports replay. The persistence cutover and this first
Archive slice do not include those pieces.

Event payloads contain observed or derived material facts, never probability.
Committed event metadata records the emitting rule and can carry an
automatically derived reference to the ``ChoiceReceiptV1`` that a finite
projection observed. Removing an event sink cannot change a material
trajectory.

Flow

Solid arrows are live. Dashed arrows are later gate work.

Invariants
----------

Tick identity
   Equal inputs produce equal graph, nominal-world, replay-tick, envelope, and
   typed semantic row bytes. Equal kernel instances produce equal allocation,
   draw, selection, and receipt bytes. Only the marker establishes durability.

Pure judgment
   Relation, BSL, and tick crates have no database dependency. Storage begins
   only after detached judgment succeeds.

Single authority
   No compatibility view, adapter, fallback, dual writer, dual storage, or
   runnable midpoint exists.

Native topology
   Hyperedges remain first-class public elements. Incidence data is an internal
   storage method.

Source honesty
   Each substantive value is ``Observed``, ``Derived``, ``Calibrated``, or
   ``Designed``.

Finite contingency
   Kernels select bounded material effects. Recognizers deterministically
   observe post-state. Exact event likelihood sums the branches that make the
   recognizer emit that event. Events never own probability.

Player relevance
   An administrative display cannot pass a game milestone. The persistence
   cutover is necessary infrastructure, not the playable decision loop.
