Imperial Rent
=============

The concept of Imperial Rent (Φ) is central to Babylon's modeling of global
class dynamics.

Definition
----------

**Imperial Rent** is the difference between wages paid in the core (W_c) and
the value produced by labor (V_c):

.. math::

   \Phi = W_c - V_c

When Φ > 0, workers in the core receive more than the value they produce.
This surplus comes from value extracted from the periphery through
unequal exchange.

Fundamental Theorem
-------------------

The **Fundamental Theorem of MLM-TW** states:

   Revolution in the Core is impossible when W_c > V_c

This is because the material conditions for revolutionary consciousness
do not exist when workers benefit from the imperial system.

Labor Aristocracy
-----------------

A social class is considered part of the **Labor Aristocracy** when:

.. math::

   \frac{W_c}{V_c} > 1

The labor aristocracy ratio determines the degree to which a class's
material interests align with imperialism rather than international
proletarian solidarity.
