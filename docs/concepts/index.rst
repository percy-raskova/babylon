Concepts
========

Theoretical foundations and core concepts of the Babylon simulation engine.

These documents explain the "why" behind the simulation mechanics—the
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Third Worldist (MLM-TW) theory that drives the
mathematical models.

Key Principles
--------------

**Graph + Math = History**
   Complex emergent behavior arises from simple topological operations
   and mathematical formulas on a graph.

**Determinism**
   Given identical initial conditions and parameters, the simulation
   produces identical results. History is path-dependent but not random.

**Material Conditions First**
   Ideology follows material reality. Consciousness is determined by
   class position and organizational context.

**No Emotions, Only Topology**
   The simulation models structure, not feelings. Revolutionary moments
   emerge from network properties, not heroic individuals.
