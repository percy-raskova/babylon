# The Vibe Coding Manifesto

*An Ideological and Technical Defense of AI-Assisted Development*

Based on empirical evidence from the Babylon project: 531 commits, 987 tests, one year of human-AI collaboration.

---

## Overview

This manifesto reclaims "vibe coding" from its dismissive origins and presents it as a legitimate, disciplined development methodology. Through extensive empirical evidence from the Babylon project, it demonstrates that AI-assisted development, when paired with proper discipline, produces high-quality, well-tested code.

## Key Arguments

1. **Vibe coding is flow, not abdication** - The bottleneck shifts from syntax to clarity of thought
2. **Empirical evidence supports it** - 531 commits, 987 tests, 1.7:1 test:code ratio
3. **Discipline is the key** - Pre-commit hooks, TDD, types, and ADRs make it sustainable
4. **It democratizes programming** - Barriers lower without quality suffering
