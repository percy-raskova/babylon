Babylon: The Fall of America
============================

A geopolitical simulation engine modeling the collapse of American hegemony
through Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Third Worldist (MLM-TW) theory.

**Graph + Math = History**

   *"Collapse is certain. Revolution is possible.*
   :hope:`Organization is the difference.`\ *"*

.. note::

   This PDF contains the complete Babylon documentation: tutorials, how-to
   guides, concepts, and reference material.

   The Necropolis Codex aesthetic reflects the grim machinery of imperial
   collapse---institutional, archival, stained with historical violence.
   Green text illuminates only content about revolutionary organization.
