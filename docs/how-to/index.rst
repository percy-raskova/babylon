How-To Guides
=============

Task-oriented guides that help you accomplish specific goals. These assume
you already understand the basics and need to solve a particular problem.

.. note::

   **Looking for tutorials?** See :doc:`/tutorials/index` for learning-oriented
   guides that build foundational knowledge.

Extending the Simulation
------------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   add-custom-system
   modding-defines
   parameter-tuning

Guides for extending and customizing the simulation mechanics.

**Add a Custom System**
   Create, register, and test custom simulation systems to model new
   mechanics like propaganda, sanctions, or environmental effects.

**Mod Game Parameters (defines.yaml)**
   Change the game's balance code-free by editing the canonical, documented,
   player-editable ``defines.yaml``. Explains the file, the load path, and how
   to revert or regenerate it.

**Tune Simulation Parameters**
   Load, modify, and analyze ``GameDefines`` parameters. Includes parameter
   sweeps and sensitivity analysis workflows.

State Apparatus AI (Feature 039)
---------------------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   state-apparatus-ai

**Work with the State Apparatus AI**
   Add new sub-verbs, tune faction dynamics, adjust the REPRESS pipeline,
   use god mode for debugging, integrate with state AI events, read
   player-visible state information, add faction shift triggers, and
   run the 52-tick integration test.

Debugging & Analysis
--------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   debug-simulation-outcomes
   analyze-parameter-sensitivity
   parameter-sweeps

**Debug Simulation Outcomes**
   Diagnose unexpected results systematically. Use structured logging,
   trace analysis, and formula verification to identify issues.

**Analyze Parameter Sensitivity**
   Explore how parameter changes affect simulation outcomes. Run sweeps,
   identify thresholds, and validate theoretical predictions.

**Run Parameter Sweeps and Optimization**
   Use the ``babylon.engine.optimization`` package for sweeps, Monte Carlo,
   global sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian search over ``GameDefines``
   coefficients, with both a fast in-memory backend and the realistic
   Postgres-backed headless backend.

GUI Development
---------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   gui-development

**GUI Development Plan**
   Build visualization and user interface features using NiceGUI.
   Covers the phased approach from basic displays to full interactivity.

Getting Started
---------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   setup-dev-environment

**Set Up a Development Environment**
   Complete setup guide for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Windows users get
   step-by-step WSL 2 installation and VSCode Remote integration.

Contributing
------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   contribute
   run-ci-locally

**Submit a Pull Request**
   Complete workflow from branching to merge. Includes branch naming,
   commit conventions, and handling CI failures.

**Run CI Locally**
   Test CI checks before pushing using direct commands, mise tasks,
   or ``gh act`` for full workflow simulation.

Coming Soon
-----------

These guides are planned for future development:

- **Optimize RAG** - Improve AI narrative generation performance
- **Build PDF Documentation** - Generate PDF books from Sphinx docs
