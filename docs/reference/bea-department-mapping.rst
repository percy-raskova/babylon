Department III: Social Reproduction
======================================

renew the capacity to work. Most labor in this department is performed as
unwaged domestic work (low *g*\ :sub:`33`), but the commodified fraction
appears in national accounts.

Boundary Cases and Notes
==========================

**Motor vehicles (3360A0 in Dept I; 336 in Dept IIb):** Two BEA codes
appear in different departments. Code ``3360A0`` (manufacturing) is placed
in Department I because the industry produces both commercial vehicles and
consumer automobiles—and commercial use dominates by output value and
productive function. Code ``336`` (retail auto sales) is in Department IIb.

**Retail trade (4400 in Dept IIa) vs. specialty retail (4481, 4521, 4529,
4530 in Dept IIb):** General retail (BEA 4400) includes food retail, which
makes it primarily a wage-goods distributor. Luxury and discretionary
specialty retailers are separated into IIb with more specific codes.

**Owner-occupied housing (FIRE0 in Dept I):** The BEA treats imputed
owner-occupied rental income as capital output. Following Shaikh & Tonak,
housing is classified as capital (Dept I) rather than consumption. This
is a contested boundary: housing is *simultaneously* a consumption good and
a capital asset. The productive capital interpretation is the default.

**Future refinement:** The MVP mapping uses dominant-use classification
(one industry → one department). A more precise approach would use the
BEA commodity-by-industry bridge tables to fractionally allocate mixed
industries by output shares. This is noted in the TOML metadata but not yet
implemented.

----

How to Update the Mapping
==========================

The mapping is defined in:

.. code-block:: text

   src/babylon/economics/tensor_hierarchy/mappings/bea_to_department.toml

**TOML structure:**

.. code-block:: toml

   [departments]
   I   = ["1100A1", "1130A1", ...]   # List of BEA codes for Dept I
   IIA = ["311FT", "313TT", ...]     # List for Dept IIa
   IIB = ["334", "336", ...]         # List for Dept IIb
   III = ["621", "622", ...]         # List for Dept III

   [metadata]
   version = "1.0.0"
   date = "2026-02-26"
   bea_classification = "2007 NAICS-based BEA Summary level"
   reference = "..."
   notes = "..."

To add or move an industry:

1. Find the BEA Summary code in the BEA I-O Use table column headers.
2. Remove it from its current department list (if present).
3. Add it to the correct department list.
4. Add a note in ``[metadata].notes`` explaining the rationale.
5. Re-run tests: ``poetry run pytest tests/unit/economics/tensor_hierarchy/``.

**How DefaultDepartmentAggregator reads it:**

.. code-block:: python

   aggregator = DefaultDepartmentAggregator()
   mapping = aggregator.get_default_mapping()
   # mapping: {"1100A1": "I", "311FT": "IIA", "334": "IIB", "621": "III", ...}

The aggregator reads the TOML at call time (not cached at import). BEA codes
not present in the mapping are silently excluded from aggregation. This is
intentional: unmapped industries contribute to the ~70-industry matrix but
not to the 4-department matrix.

**BEA code lookup:** The BEA classification (2007 NAICS-based Summary level)
is documented in the BEA I-O XLSX column headers and in the BEA interactive
data portal at `<https://www.bea.gov/industry/input-output-accounts-data>`_.
