# hypergraph-rs Phase 0+1 Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Bootstrap the `hypergraph-rs` Cargo workspace with 4 crates and implement the core `Hypergraph<N, E, M>` data structure (bipartite `StableDiGraph`) with full node/edge CRUD, membership queries, attribute access, and insertion-ordered iteration — the foundation that Phase 2 (DiHypergraph, views, conformance testing) builds on.

**Architecture:** The hypergraph IS a `rustworkx_core::petgraph::stable_graph::StableDiGraph` with two node kinds (`Agent` and `Hyperedge`) connected by `MembershipEdge` edges. This bipartite representation makes it a genuine rustworkx-core plugin. `IndexMap` bimaps provide O(1) id-based lookup while preserving insertion order (III.7 determinism parity). **Spec correction:** §3.5 of the design spec says `petgraph::graph::DiGraph` "removes nodes by leaving a hole" — that's actually `StableGraph` behavior. `Graph::remove_node` swaps the last node into the freed slot (compaction), which breaks insertion order under churn. We use `StableDiGraph` which leaves holes and preserves insertion order — matching the spec's INTENT if not its type name.

**Tech Stack:** Rust 1.79+ (matches rustworkx-core MSRV), `rustworkx-core` 0.18 (re-exports `petgraph`), `indexmap` 2, `serde` + `serde_json`, `thiserror`. BSD-3-Clause license.

## Global Constraints

- **Rust edition 2021**, MSRV 1.79 (matches `rustworkx-core`)
- **License:** BSD-3-Clause (every crate manifest declares it)
- **Workspace location:** `/hypergraph-rs/` at the babylon repo root (external dep; NOT inside `src/`)
- **Determinism (III.7 parity):** All iteration is insertion-ordered. `StableDiGraph` preserves insertion order for nodes and edges even under removal (leaves holes, doesn't compact). `IndexMap` bimaps enforce id-lookup order independently. No `HashMap` anywhere in the public iteration path.
- **No `unsafe` code** in the core crate.
- **TDD discipline:** Every task follows red → green → commit. Write the failing test first, verify it fails, implement minimal code to pass, verify it passes, commit.
- **Commit convention:** Conventional commits (`type(scope): desc`). End with `Co-Authored-By: opencode <opencode@local>` trailer.
- **Generic type defaults:** `N = serde_json::Value, E = serde_json::Value, M = serde_json::Value` — XGI-style dynamic attrs by default.
- **XGI API fidelity** (confirmed from `.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/xgi/core/hypergraph.py`):
  - `add_edge` auto-creates member nodes that don't exist (hypergraph.py:620-623)
  - `add_edge` with `idx=None` auto-generates integer IDs via a counter (hypergraph.py:617)
  - `add_edge` with duplicate `idx` warns and returns (no-op) (hypergraph.py:613-615)
  - `add_edge` deduplicates members via `set(members)` (hypergraph.py:611)
  - `remove_node` has weak (default) and strong modes (hypergraph.py:435-478)
  - `H.nodes.memberships(n)` returns a `set` of edge IDs (views.py:629)
  - `H.edges.members(e)` returns a `set` of node IDs (views.py:706+)

**Responsibility split:**
- `core/kinds.rs` — `NodeKind<N,E>` enum and `MembershipEdge<M>` struct. Pure data.
- `core/hypergraph.rs` — `Hypergraph<N,E,M>` struct and all methods. The bipartite substrate + IndexMap bimaps + all CRUD/query/iteration logic.
- `core/error.rs` — error types for missing nodes/edges.
- `lib.rs` — crate root, re-exports `core::*`.

## Phase 1: Core Data Structure

### Task 3: Test and implement `add_node` + `has_node`

**Files:**
- Create: `hypergraph-rs/tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/crates/hypergraph-rs/src/core/hypergraph.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `Hypergraph::add_node(&mut self, node_id: &str, attrs: N) -> bool` — returns `true` if new, `false` if existing. `Hypergraph::has_node(&self, node_id: &str) -> bool`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Write to `hypergraph-rs/tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`:

```rust
use hypergraph_rs::Hypergraph;

#[test]
fn test_add_node_creates_new_node() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    let created = h.add_node("a", serde_json::Value::Null);
    assert!(created);
    assert_eq!(h.num_nodes(), 1);
    assert!(h.has_node("a"));
}

#[test]
fn test_add_node_returns_false_for_existing() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    h.add_node("a", serde_json::Value::Null);
    let created = h.add_node("a", serde_json::Value::Null);
    assert!(!created);
    assert_eq!(h.num_nodes(), 1);
}

#[test]
fn test_has_node_returns_false_for_missing() {
    let h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    assert!(!h.has_node("nonexistent"));
}

#[test]
fn test_num_nodes_starts_at_zero() {
    let h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    assert_eq!(h.num_nodes(), 0);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: FAIL — `add_node` and `has_node` don't exist. Compile error.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `add_node` and `has_node`**

Add inside the `impl<N, E, M> Hypergraph<N, E, M>` block in `hypergraph.rs`, after `num_edges`:

```rust
    /// Add a node with attributes. Returns `true` if a new node was created,
    /// `false` if it already existed.
    ///
    /// XGI parity: `H.add_node(node, **attr)`.
    pub fn add_node(&mut self, node_id: &str, attrs: N) -> bool {
        if self.agent_ids.contains_key(node_id) {
            return false;
        }
        let idx = self.inner.add_node(NodeKind::Agent(attrs));
        self.agent_ids.insert(node_id.to_string(), idx);
        true
    }

    /// Check if a node exists in the hypergraph.
    ///
    /// XGI parity: `n in H` / `H.has_node(n)`.
    pub fn has_node(&self, node_id: &str) -> bool {
        self.agent_ids.contains_key(node_id)
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: PASS — 4 tests, 0 failures.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd hypergraph-rs
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(hypergraph-rs): implement add_node + has_node

Co-Authored-By: opencode <opencode@local>"
```

### Task 4: Test and implement `add_edge` with auto-node-creation and auto-id

**Files:**
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/crates/hypergraph-rs/src/core/hypergraph.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `Hypergraph::add_edge(&mut self, members: Vec<String>, idx: Option<String>, attrs: E) -> Result<String, EdgeError>` where `N: Default, M: Default + Clone`. Auto-creates member nodes. Deduplicates members. Returns `EdgeError::AlreadyExists` for duplicate `idx`, `EdgeError::EmptyMembers` for empty members.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`:

```rust
use hypergraph_rs::EdgeError;

#[test]
fn test_add_edge_with_explicit_idx() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    let edge_id = h.add_edge(
        vec!["a".to_string(), "b".to_string(), "c".to_string()],
        Some("myedge".to_string()),
        serde_json::Value::Null,
    ).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(edge_id, "myedge");
    assert_eq!(h.num_edges(), 1);
    assert_eq!(h.num_nodes(), 3);
}

#[test]
fn test_add_edge_auto_generates_id() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    let id1 = h.add_edge(vec!["a".to_string(), "b".to_string()], None, serde_json::Value::Null).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(id1, "0");
    let id2 = h.add_edge(vec!["c".to_string(), "d".to_string()], None, serde_json::Value::Null).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(id2, "1");
}

#[test]
fn test_add_edge_duplicate_idx_returns_error() {

Note: The linear search through bimaps is O(n) per neighbor — a placeholder. A later optimization adds a reverse bimap for O(1) lookup. Babylon's scale (~1000 nodes / ~50 edges) makes this acceptable for now.

### Task 10: Test and implement attribute access (`node_attrs`, `edge_attrs`, mut variants)

**Files:**
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/crates/hypergraph-rs/src/core/hypergraph.rs`

**Interfaces:**

### Task 15: Test and implement `add_node_to_edge` + `remove_node_from_edge`

**Files:**

**XGI source reference** (hypergraph.py:~860-890, ~920-950): `add_node_to_edge` auto-creates edge and node if either doesn't exist. `remove_node_from_edge` raises XGIError if edge/node missing or node not in edge; removes empty edge by default.

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: FAIL — `add_node_to_edge` and `remove_node_from_edge` don't exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement both methods**

Add inside the impl block:

```rust
    /// Add a node to an existing edge. Auto-creates both if missing.
    /// XGI parity: `H.add_node_to_edge(edge, node)`.
    pub fn add_node_to_edge(&mut self, edge_id: &str, node_id: &str) -> Result<(), EdgeError>

        if !self.hyperedge_ids.contains_key(edge_id) {
            let he_idx = self.inner.add_node(NodeKind::Hyperedge(E::default()));
            self.hyperedge_ids.insert(edge_id.to_string(), he_idx);
            // Update uid counter if edge_id is numeric
            if let Ok(n) = edge_id.parse::<u64>() {

            self.agent_ids.insert(node_id.to_string(), nidx);
        }
        // Add the membership edges (both directions for undirected)
        let agent_idx = self.agent_ids[node_id];
        let he_idx = self.hyperedge_ids[edge_id];
        // Check if membership already exists
        if self.inner.find_edge(agent_idx, he_idx).is_none() {
            let membership = MembershipEdge { member_data: M::default() };
            self.inner.add_edge(agent_idx, he_idx, membership.clone());
            self.inner.add_edge(he_idx, agent_idx, membership);
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Remove a node from an existing edge.
    /// XGI parity: `H.remove_node_from_edge(edge, node, remove_empty=True)`.
    pub fn remove_node_from_edge(
        &mut self,
        edge_id: &str,
        node_id: &str,
        remove_empty: bool,
    ) -> Result<(), NodeError> {
        let he_idx = *self.hyperedge_ids.get(edge_id).ok_or(NodeError::NotFound {
            node_id: edge_id.to_string(),
        })?;
        let agent_idx = *self.agent_ids.get(node_id).ok_or(NodeError::NotFound {
            node_id: node_id.to_string(),
        })?;

        // Check if the node is actually in the edge
        let edge_to_he = self.inner.find_edge(agent_idx, he_idx);
        let edge_from_he = self.inner.find_edge(he_idx, agent_idx);
        if edge_to_he.is_none() {
            return Err(NodeError::NotFound {
                node_id: format!("node {} not in edge {}", node_id, edge_id),
            });
        }

        // Remove the bipartite membership edges
        if let Some(e) = edge_to_he {
            self.inner.remove_edge(e);
        }
        if let Some(e) = edge_from_he {
            self.inner.remove_edge(e);
        }

        // Check if edge is now empty
        if remove_empty {
            let has_members = self.inner.neighbors(he_idx).any(|n| {
                matches!(self.inner.node_weight(n), Some(NodeKind::Agent(_)))
            });
            if !has_members {
                self.inner.remove_node(he_idx);
                self.hyperedge_ids.shift_remove(edge_id);
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }
```

Note: `add_node_to_edge` requires `E: Default` as well (to auto-create the edge with default attrs). Add that bound:

```rust
    pub fn add_node_to_edge(&mut self, edge_id: &str, node_id: &str) -> Result<(), EdgeError>
    where
        N: Default,
        E: Default,
        M: Default + Clone,
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: PASS — all 56 tests, 0 failures.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

### Task 16: Test and implement `set_node_attributes` + `set_edge_attributes`

**Files:**
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/crates/hypergraph-rs/src/core/hypergraph.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `set_node_attributes(&mut self, values: impl Iterator<Item = (String, serde_json::Map)>)` — bulk set node attrs from (id, attr_map) pairs. `set_edge_attributes` — same for edges. Skips missing IDs silently (XGI behavior with a warning).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`:

```rust
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

#[test]
fn test_set_node_attributes_from_pairs() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    h.add_node("a", serde_json::Value::Null);
    h.add_node("b", serde_json::Value::Null);

    let mut attrs_a = serde_json::Map::new();
    attrs_a.insert("color".to_string(), serde_json::json!("red"));
    let mut attrs_b = serde_json::Map::new();
    attrs_b.insert("color".to_string(), serde_json::json!("blue"));

    h.set_node_attributes(vec![
        ("a".to_string(), attrs_a),
        ("b".to_string(), attrs_b),
    ]);

    assert_eq!(h.node_attrs("a").unwrap()["color"], "red");
    assert_eq!(h.node_attrs("b").unwrap()["color"], "blue");
}

#[test]
fn test_set_node_attributes_skips_missing() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    h.add_node("a", serde_json::Value::Null);

    let mut attrs = serde_json::Map::new();
    attrs.insert("x".to_string(), serde_json::json!(1));

    h.set_node_attributes(vec![
        ("a".to_string(), attrs.clone()),
        ("nonexistent".to_string(), attrs),
    ]);

    // "a" got the attribute, "nonexistent" was silently skipped
    assert_eq!(h.node_attrs("a").unwrap()["x"], 1);
}

#[test]
fn test_set_edge_attributes_from_pairs() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    h.add_edge(vec!["a".to_string()], Some("e1".to_string()), serde_json::Value::Null).unwrap();
    h.add_edge(vec!["b".to_string()], Some("e2".to_string()), serde_json::Value::Null).unwrap();

    let mut attrs_e1 = serde_json::Map::new();
    attrs_e1.insert("weight".to_string(), serde_json::json!(5));
    let mut attrs_e2 = serde_json::Map::new();
    attrs_e2.insert("weight".to_string(), serde_json::json!(10));

    h.set_edge_attributes(vec![
        ("e1".to_string(), attrs_e1),
        ("e2".to_string(), attrs_e2),
    ]);

    assert_eq!(h.edge_attrs("e1").unwrap()["weight"], 5);
    assert_eq!(h.edge_attrs("e2").unwrap()["weight"], 10);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: FAIL — `set_node_attributes` and `set_edge_attributes` don't exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement both methods**

Add inside the impl block:

```rust
    /// Set node attributes from (id, attr_map) pairs.
    /// XGI parity: `H.set_node_attributes(values, name=None)`.
    /// Silently skips missing node IDs (XGI warns).
    pub fn set_node_attributes(
        &mut self,
        values: impl IntoIterator<Item = (String, serde_json::Map<String, serde_json::Value>)>,
    ) {
        for (node_id, attrs) in values {
            if let Some(node_attrs) = self.node_attrs_mut(&node_id) {
                if let Some(obj) = node_attrs.as_object_mut() {
                    for (k, v) in attrs {
                        obj.insert(k, v);
                    }
                }
            }
            // Silently skip missing nodes (XGI warns)
        }
    }

    /// Set edge attributes from (id, attr_map) pairs.
    /// XGI parity: `H.set_edge_attributes(values, name=None)`.
    /// Silently skips missing edge IDs (XGI warns).
    pub fn set_edge_attributes(
        &mut self,
        values: impl IntoIterator<Item = (String, serde_json::Map<String, serde_json::Value>)>,
    ) {
        for (edge_id, attrs) in values {
            if let Some(edge_attrs) = self.edge_attrs_mut(&edge_id) {
                if let Some(obj) = edge_attrs.as_object_mut() {
                    for (k, v) in attrs {
                        obj.insert(k, v);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

Note: This implementation assumes `N`/`E` are `serde_json::Value` (the default). For generic `N`/`E`, these methods would need different signatures. Since the defaults are `serde_json::Value`, this covers XGI parity. Babylon can later specialize with typed setters.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: PASS — all 59 tests, 0 failures.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

### Task 17: Test and implement `clear_edges` + `freeze` / `is_frozen`

**Files:**
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/crates/hypergraph-rs/src/core/hypergraph.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `clear_edges(&mut self)` — removes all edges, keeps nodes. `freeze(&mut self)` — sets a frozen flag. `is_frozen(&self) -> bool`. When frozen, mutation methods should panic.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_clear_edges_keeps_nodes() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    h.add_edge(vec!["a".to_string(), "b".to_string()], Some("e1".to_string()), serde_json::json!({"w": 1})).unwrap();
    h.add_node("lonely", serde_json::json!({"x": 1}));
    h.clear_edges();
    assert_eq!(h.num_nodes(), 3); // a, b, lonely all kept
    assert_eq!(h.num_edges(), 0);
    // Node attrs preserved
    assert_eq!(h.node_attrs("lonely").unwrap()["x"], 1);
    // No memberships
    assert!(h.memberships("a").unwrap().is_empty());
}

#[test]
fn test_freeze_prevents_mutation() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    h.add_node("a", serde_json::Value::Null);
    h.freeze();
    assert!(h.is_frozen());
    // Mutation should panic
    let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe(|| {
        let mut h = h;
        h.add_node("b", serde_json::Value::Null);
    }));
    assert!(result.is_err(), "add_node should panic when frozen");
}

#[test]
fn test_is_frozen_false_by_default() {
    let h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    assert!(!h.is_frozen());
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: FAIL — `clear_edges`, `freeze`, `is_frozen` don't exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add `frozen` field and implement the methods**

First, add a `frozen` field to the `Hypergraph` struct:

```rust
pub struct Hypergraph<N = serde_json::Value, E = serde_json::Value, M = serde_json::Value> {
    inner: StableDiGraph<NodeKind<N, E>, MembershipEdge<M>>,
    agent_ids: IndexMap<String, NodeIndex>,
    hyperedge_ids: IndexMap<String, NodeIndex>,
    edge_uid_counter: u64,
    graph_attrs: serde_json::Map<String, serde_json::Value>,
    frozen: bool,  // NEW
}
```

Update `new()`:
```rust
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            inner: StableDiGraph::new(),
            agent_ids: IndexMap::new(),
            hyperedge_ids: IndexMap::new(),
            edge_uid_counter: 0,
            graph_attrs: serde_json::Map::new(),
            frozen: false,  // NEW
        }
    }
```

Update `clear()` to also reset `frozen`:
```rust
    pub fn clear(&mut self) {
        self.inner = StableDiGraph::new();
        self.agent_ids.clear();
        self.hyperedge_ids.clear();
        self.edge_uid_counter = 0;
        self.graph_attrs.clear();
        self.frozen = false;  // NEW
    }
```

Update `copy()` to copy `frozen`:
```rust
    pub fn copy(&self) -> Self where N: Clone, E: Clone, M: Clone {
        Self {
            inner: self.inner.clone(),
            agent_ids: self.agent_ids.clone(),
            hyperedge_ids: self.hyperedge_ids.clone(),
            edge_uid_counter: self.edge_uid_counter,
            graph_attrs: self.graph_attrs.clone(),
            frozen: self.frozen,  // NEW
        }
    }
```

Add the new methods:

```rust
    /// Remove all edges, keeping nodes.
    /// XGI parity: `H.clear_edges()`.
    pub fn clear_edges(&mut self) {
        // Remove all hyperedge nodes from the bipartite graph
        for (_, &he_idx) in &self.hyperedge_ids.clone() {
            self.inner.remove_node(he_idx);
        }
        self.hyperedge_ids.clear();
        // Reset edge counter
        self.edge_uid_counter = 0;
    }

    /// Freeze the hypergraph, preventing modification.
    /// XGI parity: `H.freeze()`.
    pub fn freeze(&mut self) {
        self.frozen = true;
    }

    /// Check if the hypergraph is frozen.
    /// XGI parity: `H.is_frozen`.
    pub fn is_frozen(&self) -> bool {
        self.frozen
    }
```

Add a frozen guard to `add_node`, `add_edge`, `remove_node`, `remove_edge`, `add_node_to_edge`, `remove_node_from_edge`, `clear`, `clear_edges`:

```rust
    fn assert_not_frozen(&self) {
        if self.frozen {
            panic!("Frozen hypergraph can't be modified");
        }
    }
```

Call `self.assert_not_frozen();` at the top of each mutation method.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: PASS — all 62 tests, 0 failures.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd hypergraph-rs
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(hypergraph-rs): implement clear_edges + freeze/is_frozen

### Task 18: Test and implement `__repr__` / `Debug` formatting

**Files:**
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`
- Modify: `hypergraph-rs/crates/hypergraph-rs/src/core/hypergraph.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `impl std::fmt::Debug for Hypergraph` — XGI v0.10.2 `__repr__` parity: `Hypergraph([{members}, ...])`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/core/test_hypergraph.rs`:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_debug_format_matches_xgi_repr() {
    let mut h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    h.add_edge(vec!["a".to_string(), "b".to_string(), "c".to_string()], None, serde_json::Value::Null).unwrap();
    h.add_edge(vec!["b".to_string(), "c".to_string()], None, serde_json::Value::Null).unwrap();
    let repr = format!("{:?}", h);
    // XGI __repr__ returns: Hypergraph([{a, b, c}, {b, c}])
    // Our Debug should include the class name and edge members
    assert!(repr.contains("Hypergraph"));
    assert!(repr.contains("a"));
    assert!(repr.contains("b"));
    assert!(repr.contains("c"));
}

#[test]
fn test_debug_format_empty() {
    let h: Hypergraph = Hypergraph::new();
    let repr = format!("{:?}", h);
    assert!(repr.contains("Hypergraph"));
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: FAIL — `Debug` not implemented (the derive on the struct doesn't give XGI-parity repr).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `Debug`**

Add OUTSIDE the inherent impl block:

```rust
impl<N, E, M> std::fmt::Debug for Hypergraph<N, E, M>
where
    N: std::fmt::Debug,
    E: std::fmt::Debug,
    M: std::fmt::Debug,
{
    /// XGI parity: `__repr__` returns `Hypergraph([{members}, ...])`.
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "Hypergraph(")?;
        let edges: Vec<String> = self.hyperedge_ids.keys().map(|eid| {
            let members = self.members(eid).unwrap_or_default();
            format!("{{{}}}", members.join(", "))
        }).collect();
        write!(f, "[{}])", edges.join(", "))
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test -p hypergraph-rs --test test_hypergraph`
Expected: PASS — all 64 tests, 0 failures.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd hypergraph-rs
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(hypergraph-rs): implement Debug (XGI __repr__ parity)

### Task 19: Run clippy, fix warnings, verify full suite

**Files:**
- Modify: any files with clippy warnings

- [ ] **Step 1: Run clippy on the core crate**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo clippy -p hypergraph-rs -- -D warnings`
Expected: May have warnings. Fix all of them.

- [ ] **Step 2: Fix any clippy warnings**

Common fixes: remove unused imports, use `&str` instead of `&String`, add `#[allow(clippy::xxx)]` with a comment for false positives.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run clippy on all workspace crates**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
Expected: PASS — no warnings.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the full test suite**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo test --workspace`
Expected: PASS — all 49 tests, 0 failures.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run rustfmt**

Run: `cd hypergraph-rs && cargo fmt --all`

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit formatting/clippy fixes**

```bash
cd hypergraph-rs

## Phase 0+1 Completion Summary

After completing all 19 tasks, the `hypergraph-rs` workspace has:

- **4 crates**: `hypergraph-rs` (core), `hypergraph-rs-python` (PyO3 stub), `hypergraph-rs-wasm` (WASM stub), `hypergraph-rs-cli` (CLI stub)
- **Core `Hypergraph<N, E, M>` struct** (XGI v0.10.2 API parity) with:
  - `new`, `default`, `clear`, `clear_edges`, `copy`, `freeze`, `is_frozen`
  - `add_node`, `has_node`, `remove_node` (weak + strong)
  - `add_edge` (auto-node, auto-id, dedup), `has_edge`, `remove_edge`
  - `add_node_to_edge`, `remove_node_from_edge`
  - `memberships`, `members`
  - `node_attrs`/`mut`, `edge_attrs`/`mut`
  - `set_node_attributes`, `set_edge_attributes` (bulk)
  - `graph_attr`, `set_graph_attr`
  - `node_ids`, `edge_ids` (insertion-ordered)
  - `num_nodes`, `num_edges`
  - `add_nodes_from`, `add_edges_from` (bulk)
  - `PartialEq` (structural equality), `Debug` (XGI `__repr__` parity)
- **64 unit tests** all passing
- **Clippy clean**, **rustfmt clean**
- **StableDiGraph bipartite substrate** (genuine rustworkx-core plugin)
- **IndexMap bimaps** for insertion-ordered id lookup (III.7 determinism parity)
- **Frozen guard** on all mutation methods (XGI `freeze()` parity)

**XGI v0.10.2 core API coverage**: all methods in `xgi/core/hypergraph.py` are now implemented except `double_edge_swap`, `random_edge_shuffle`, `merge_duplicate_edges`, `cleanup`, `dual`, and `update` — these are deferred to Phase 2 (they're higher-level operations, not core CRUD).

**Next: Phase 2** — DiHypergraph, SimplicialComplex, NodeView/EdgeView proxy objects, and porting XGI's `test_hypergraph.py` as the first conformance gate.
