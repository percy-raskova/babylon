# Volume III Money Through the Value–Price Scissors — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Connect the fully-built-but-disconnected Volume III financial estate (`domain/economics/{distribution,credit,rent,counter_tendencies,financial_crisis,monetary}`) to the running engine, so real FRED-grounded claims on surplus value anchor and close the price⟷value scissors loop, bind four new dialectical oppositions, and ship the five sentinel classes this investigation discovered.

**Architecture:** Five layers stack onto the existing engine without new primitives — Layer 1 (Ledger of Claims, `s = p + i + r + t`) is turned on via `calculator_overrides`; Layer 1b publishes `NationalFinancialParameters` to the graph under a new key so CONSEQUENCE-phase Systems can read it in the same tick; Layer 2 is a pure `domain/` monetary anchor with an honest-absence contract (`NoDataSentinel`, never a fabricated zero); Layer 3 grows the opposition catalog 6 → 10 and gives `CouplingGraph` its first production consumer; Layer 4 closes the scissors loop by tightening `serviceable_divergence` with the real interest burden and pulling the fictitious oscillator toward the anchor where data exists. Past 2024 the oscillator's own dynamics *are* the money system (owner decision D1) — absence is the tested default, covering ~85% of a campaign.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, Poetry, Mise, Pydantic (frozen models), rustworkx (`BabylonGraph`), pytest + Hypothesis (property laws), Ruff/MyPy strict, PostgreSQL runtime + SQLite reference DB, FRED/Z.1 federal data adapters.

## Global Constraints


House rules — every task's requirements implicitly include all of these:

- **TDD, no exceptions.** Red → green → refactor. A "red phase" means *an assertion fails because production code is wrong* — a missing file, a missing test-file import, or a collection error is **not** a red phase. Where a task's production code already landed in a prior task, inject the defect, prove the red, then `git checkout --` to restore.
  - **Carve-out, added by pre-flight (M1):** for a task whose *deliverable is a new module*, no reachable state produces an assertion-level red — the honest options are a deferred in-function import (still not an assertion) or the collection error itself. Those tasks (U1.2, U3.1) may take the collection error as their red. Do **not** spend execution time manufacturing an artificial assertion. The strict rule holds, unchanged, for every task editing existing production code.
- **Never run the full unit suite.** `mise run check` includes the xdist `test:unit` leg (~1 GB/worker). Use `mise run check:quick` + scoped `mise run test:q -- <path>`.
- **Every commit** uses `mise run commit -- "type(scope): msg"`, conventional format, and ends with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
  - **Exception, added by pre-flight (M4):** where a commit requires an *exact, curated file list*, use plain `git add`/`git commit` — `mise run commit`'s re-staging sweep is documented to defeat deliberately partial staging. Conventional format and the trailer still apply. This exception exists for U8.5's ceremony commit; do not invoke it elsewhere.
  - **Always verify HEAD moved** after committing (`git log --oneline -1`). The pre-commit hooks can rewrite staged files and abort while printing all-green.
  - **This worktree's `.mise.toml` has been trusted.** If `mise` reports "Config files … are not trusted", run `mise trust` — do not work around it.
- **Never commit an empty index.** If a task's Steps 1–4 modify no file, either produce a real artifact or delete the commit step.
- **Determinism (III.7):** sorted iteration on every new graph/dict traversal; no RNG, no wall clock, no I/O in `domain/`; all mutation via `model_copy(update=…)` on frozen models.
- **Honest absence (III.11):** `NoDataSentinel(fips=, year=, reason=)` with a *specific* reason. Never a fabricated zero, never a default substituted for missing data.
- **Zero inline coefficients (III.1):** every tunable is a `GameDefines` field regenerated into `src/babylon/data/defines.yaml` via `poetry run python tools/generate_defines_config.py`.
- **Layering:** `kernel` < `models`/`formulas` < `topology` < `domain` < `persistence` < `engine`. `domain/` imports nothing from `engine/`. Enforced by `mise run lint:imports`.
- **Line numbers in this plan are authoring-time hints only and are stale by construction** — earlier tasks insert and delete lines in the same files. **Locate every edit site by quoted unique text, never by line number.** If the quoted anchor is not found verbatim, STOP and report the drift; do not work around it.

Binding interface contract — the authoritative names, verbatim:

- `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR = "national_financial"` — graph.graph key, defined in `tick/graph_bridge.py` (U3).
- `GraphInputs` new fields (U5), each `float | None = field(default=None)`: `rentier_share`, `debt_ratio`, `credit_fragility`, `financialization_index`.
- Anchor (U4), `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py`:
  `fictitious_anchor(stock: FictitiousCapitalStock | None, real_output: float | None) -> float | NoDataSentinel`
  `serviceability_anchor(distribution: SurplusValueDistribution | None) -> float | NoDataSentinel`
- FRED fixture (U1): `tests/fixtures/vol3_fred_series.json`, shape `{"<SERIES_ID>": {"<year>": <float>}}`, **ten** series.
- New `MarketDefines` fields (U6): `anchor_pull`, `correction_interest_slope`, `correction_debt_slope`.
- New opposition keys (U5), all `antagonistic=False`: `"surplus_distribution"` (enterprise/rentier, county), `"debt_spiral"` (solvent/indebted, county), `"credit"` (accommodation/fragility, `""`), `"financial"` (real/fictitious, `""`).
- New sentinel packages (U7): `sentinels/{liveness,aggregation,coupling}/`; gate-blindness extends `sentinels/coverage/`.
- ADR numbers: **U7.10 = ADR082**, **U8.6 = ADR083** (verified: highest existing is ADR081).

## Execution Order


```
U1 → U2 → U3 → U4 → U5 → U6 → U7 → U8
```

**This order is corrected from the orchestrator's original slate, which placed U8 before U7. That was wrong: U8.2 Step 5 states "against the real repo state (U1–U7 already landed)" and U8.6's ADR enumerates U7's sentinel packages as shipped. U8 is terminal by construction — it captures the diff everything before it produced and owns the ceremony.**

Hard constraints, each with the reason it cannot be relaxed:

1. **U2 before every long run.** U2.1 removes `le=2040` from `NationalTickParameters`, which sits on the already-live MELT path. Year 2041 arrives at tick ≈1612 of a 5200-tick campaign. U1's only scenario run is `max_ticks=1`, so U1 → U2 is safe; nothing after U2 may run long without it.
2. **U2 before U3.** U3.2 rewrites the same method U2.5 fixes. See correction C-1: U3 must *preserve* U2.5's 3-tuple, not revert it.
3. **U3 before U6, not before U4.** U4's anchors are pure functions of an already-resolved `FictitiousCapitalStock` object; they never read `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR`. The real U3 consumer is U6.8's `_read_fictitious_anchor`.
4. **U4 before U6.** U6.8 imports `fictitious_anchor`; U6.6 imports `serviceability_anchor`.
5. **U5 before U7.** U7.7's `MEASUREMENT_DEPENDENCIES` declares oppositions U5.2 binds and reads fields U5.7 produces.
6. **U6 before U7.** U7.3's `national_financial` liveness row names `market_scissors.py` as a consumer — only true after U6.8. U7.6's aggregation scan-set is only clean after U6.1 replaces the unweighted `_mean_profit_rate`. If U7.6 reds on that symbol, U6.1 did not land — go fix U6.1; **do not** add an `AggregationExemption` (that would be a false liveness claim).
7. **U3.4 before U5.7.** `credit_state` has no producer anywhere in the codebase today. Without U3.4 the `credit` opposition reads absent forever and the `credit → financial` `transforms` edge permanently demotes `financial` from principal ranking — a silent behavioural bug with no test covering it.
8. **The determinism proof runs FIRST inside U7, not in U8.** Spec §5 hazard 2 is explicit: same-inputs → same-outputs across every construction site must be verified **empirically before U7**, not inferred from reading code (ADR056 precedent: the *planned* proof was wrong and only an empirical run caught it). U8.1 is therefore relabelled **U7.0** and re-run post-regeneration at U8.5 Step 5.

> ## ⛔ HARD STOP — U8.4 OWNER APPROVAL GATE ⛔
>
> **No baseline file may be regenerated until the owner has read `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md` and recorded verbatim approval in its Owner Approval Gate section.**
>
> Do **not** interpret silence, a general "looks good", or the conversation moving on to the next task as approval. U8.5 Step 1 re-checks with `grep -A1 "Approved by:"` and **halts** if it finds a placeholder. This gate is the strongest part of the plan; it was reviewed by all four auditors and none proposed a change to it. Leave it exactly as written.

## Pre-flight


Before Task U1.1, confirm the following in `/home/user/projects/game/babylon-vol3`:

1. **Worktree + branch** — `git branch --show-current` returns `refactor/vol3-money-scissors`. ✅ verified at plan-authoring time.
2. **`data/` symlink farm** — already linked: `data -> /home/user/projects/game/babylon/data`. ✅ verified. U1.1 is therefore a *verification* task, not a repair task; if `ls -la data` shows a live symlink, record that and move on. `mise run doctor` step 3b is the canonical check. U1.2's fixture export reads the reference DB through this link — it is a hard prerequisite for U1.2 and for nothing else.
3. **ADR numbering** — `ls ai/decisions/ | grep -oE 'ADR[0-9]+' | sort -u | tail -1` returns `ADR081`. ✅ verified. U7.10 claims **ADR082**, U8.6 claims **ADR083**. If other work has landed on `dev` since, trust the command's output over these numbers and shift both, preserving the U7-before-U8 ordering.
4. **Editable-venv shadow** — worktrees share the main checkout's editable install. Prefix ad-hoc `python -c` invocations with `PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src"` so you are exercising *this* worktree's source, not `babylon/`'s.
5. **Sentinel package layout** — `src/babylon/sentinels/` currently contains `_ast.py`, `base.py`, `conservation/`, `coverage/`, `dynamic.py`, `partition/`, `roundtrip/`, `seam/`, `synthetic/`. ✅ verified. `liveness/`, `aggregation/`, `coupling/` do not exist and are created by U7.
6. **Resource discipline** — run heavy commands uncapped (earlyoom is the backstop), but **never fan out parallel agents that each spawn pytest**. Scoped `mise run test:q` only.
7. **Spec self-inconsistency, fix independently of the plan** — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-vol3-money-scissors-design.md:370` says "Twelve of thirteen rows"; the table at `:375-389` has **fifteen** rows. Replace `Defects found during investigation. Twelve of thirteen rows were confirmed verbatim by the` with `Defects found during investigation. Fourteen of the fifteen rows were confirmed verbatim by the`.

## A Note On This Document

The audit's correction list and gap-fill tasks have **already been applied** into the unit
tasks below — they are not pending work. What follows is the reconciled plan. The audit
findings themselves are recorded in the Self-Review Record at the end of this document.

One correction was applied by hand after the automated pass: the empirical determinism proof
(spec §5 hazard 2) was cut from U8 for repositioning but its paste into U7 was lost to a
cross-file scope boundary. It is restored as **Task U7.0**, with both of its travelling
corrections applied (a real injected-defect red phase, and the commit trailer).

## Self-Review Record


**What was reconciled across auditors.** Four blockers were found independently by three or four auditors each, which is strong evidence they are real rather than artifacts of one reviewer's model: the `_compute_national_financial_state` signature clash (all four), the missing `credit_state` producer (three), the catalog-docstring double-edit (three), and the ADR082 collision (three). All four are resolved above with a named authoritative unit and exact replacements.

**Where auditors disagreed, and how it was decided.** Four genuine conflicts:

1. **`serviceability_anchor`** — names said declare it dormant; coverage said wire it. **Wiring won.** Dormancy would ship a computed-but-never-consumed defect in the same program that adds the sensor for that class, and would leave `correction_interest_slope = 2.0` calibrated for a quantity (i/(c+v)) that no section of the spec asks for. Wiring simultaneously satisfies §3.3, §3.5.1, and U7.8's `check_declared_edges_are_grounded` invariant. names' dormancy row is dropped.
2. **`credit_fragility_scale` placement** — names said move it to `capital_vol3`; coverage said leave it in `TensionDefines` and just document the exception. **The move won.** `default_rate_estimate` — the other factor of the same product — already lives in `capital_vol3`, and splitting one product across two categories is precisely the modding failure the category exists to prevent. coverage's dissent (that §3.5's "every new coefficient becomes a `GameDefines.market` field" scopes only the *scissors* coefficients) is correct as far as it goes but does not argue for `TensionDefines` specifically.
3. **`credit_state`'s producer** — three auditors, three different service APIs, none verified against the code. **No auditor won.** U3.4 ships coverage's version (the only internally complete one) behind a mandatory Step 0 that reads the real signatures first. This is the one place the plan knowingly hands an executor an unresolved question, and it is flagged as such rather than papered over.
4. **U7.9's gate estate** — names proposed `exempt_keys` with a written reason; placeholders proposed dropping the economics estate entirely plus a whole-factory-injection shortcut. **Both were adopted**, because they fix different halves: the shortcut is needed or the *financial* estate reds too, and the exemption is needed or the *economics* estate reds. Spec §4 U7 explicitly sanctions "explicitly narrowed with a reason", which is what `exempt_reason` records.

**Gaps found and filled.** Nine spec elements had no covering task; four warranted new tasks, reproduced in full above: U1.9 (U1's two headline acceptance criteria — `surplus_distribution` non-`None` in a real run and SC-001 — were never proven by anything that ran the engine), U2.8 (the 5200-tick crossing of 2040 was tested only in isolation), U3.4 (`credit_state` had no producer at all), U5.10 (`DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD` would have remained dead after the program that claims to wire it). The other five gaps were filled with in-place edits: three missing liveness rows, the owed-list test plus its exact `state.yaml` text, the `validate_detroit.py` convergence check, the inline-coefficient grep, the unsorted-hydration fix, and the hazard-3 shadow-accumulator gate.

**Placeholders rewritten.** Roughly 65 placeholder tokens were found. Eleven `...` / `# ...` elisions inside code blocks an agent is told to paste (U2.2 ×3, U2.3 ×3, U2.4 ×3, U2.5 ×1, U6.6 ×1) were converted into precise insert-above-this-anchor instructions. The ~60 `<FILL>` markers in `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md` gained an actual gate (`test_report_has_no_unfilled_placeholders_outside_the_approval_gate`) — previously only a manual `grep` guarded them, so the committed evidence artifact could have shipped with all sixty and still passed every structural test. Two `<FILL>`s that would have entered immutable history — one in a heredoc commit message, one in an ADR's `consequences:` block, which was 100% placeholder — were replaced with resolved shell variables and authored text respectively. Two "WHAT without HOW" steps in U7.10 (`index.yaml` and `state.yaml` edits described only in prose) gained literal YAML.

**Fabricated values.** U6.8 pinned six 17-digit floats as "captured before the anchor-pull wiring landed" — but no step in U6.1–U6.7 captures them, and `MarketDefines()` defaults are quoted nowhere in the plan. They were authored, not measured. A Step 0 now *measures* them, with an explicit instruction that the captured value is authoritative over the plan's literal. This mattered more than it looks: a single wrong digit would have turned Step 2's red into a false signal, and the natural recovery ("fix the pin to whatever the code emits") destroys the bit-identity test's entire purpose.

**TDD discipline.** Eight tasks had no real red phase. Six told the executor outright to expect PASS on the "verify it fails" step (U1.4, U3.3, U4.2, U4.5, U8.1) or to treat a missing file / a missing test-file `import math` as the red. One (U4.6 Step 2) was self-contradictory and literally unexecutable — it instructed the executor to verify the non-existence of a test, then abandoned the mutation mid-sentence. All eight now inject a specific defect, name the exact expected failure text, and restore with `git checkout --`. Two tasks (U4.8, U5.9) ended with a commit step after Steps 1–4 that modified no file — a commit with an empty index aborts and leaves the plan in a false "done" state; both now produce a real evidence artifact first. Three assertions that pinned nothing were replaced: `assert mock_run.called` (asserts a mock the test installed was called), `assert "vol3" in text.lower()` (vacuously true on a branch named `refactor/vol3-money-scissors`), and a dict-equality check in a test named "deterministic sorted" (dict `==` is order-insensitive).

**Determinism.** Four defects in test/sensor code: a `sorted(set(...))` on a non-unique key in U7.6, whose tie-break falls through to hash-randomized set iteration while `PYTHONHASHSEED` is deliberately unpinned; an `importlib.reload` under `monkeypatch` that leaks a poisoned module-level snapshot to every later test in the xdist worker if the assertion above it fails; an import-time `GameDefines.load_default()` in two `domain/` modules, which reads `defines.yaml` from disk on every process start (including layer-0.5 sentinel processes) and freezes the value before any runtime override can reach it; and one unsorted FIPS hydration. All four are fixed.

**Reordering.** The orchestrator's slate ran U8 before U7, but U8.2 Step 5 says "U1–U7 already landed" and U8.6's ADR enumerates U7's packages as shipped. Corrected to U1→U8 sequential. Separately, spec §5 hazard 2 requires the empirical determinism proof **before U7** — so U8.1 is relabelled U7.0 and runs first inside U7, with a re-run after regeneration at U8.5 Step 5. This is not pedantry: ADR056's precedent is that the *planned* determinism proof was wrong and only an empirical run caught it.

**Systemic issue, mitigated rather than eliminated.** Every task anchors edits to exact line numbers, and four in U5 alone are already wrong against HEAD — worse, they are stale *by construction*, since U5.1 appends fields, U5.2 inserts ~60 lines, and U5.3 replaces the docstring in the same file U5.4 then edits. A global anchoring convention is now stated in Global Constraints and the four worst offenders were retro-fitted with unique-text anchors. The remaining line numbers stay as hints; the convention tells the executor to STOP and report drift rather than work around a missing anchor.

**Categories that found nothing, stated plainly.** Commit hygiene is clean in U1–U7: every commit is conventional-format with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer. All five trailer omissions are confined to U8. The binding interface contract holds byte-for-byte across all eight units for `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR`, the four `GraphInputs` field names and their `float | None = field(default=None)` types, both anchor signatures including their `float | NoDataSentinel` returns and parameter order, the FRED fixture path and shape, the three `MarketDefines` field names, all four opposition keys with their poles/levels/`antagonistic=False`, and the sentinel package layout. The `NoDataSentinel(fips=, year=, reason=)` keyword form is identical across U2.2, U3.2, U4.1, U4.3 and U4.4. `create_financial_services`'s new parameter is keyword-only with a default, so U1.3's and U1.6's existing calls stay valid. `_advance`'s new `anchor=None` keyword keeps `_step_county_axes`'s five positional calls valid, as U6.8 claims. And U8.4's owner-approval gate needed no changes at all — all four auditors examined it and one called it the strongest section of the plan: a hard STOP with an explicit anti-inference clause, a re-check in U8.5 Step 1, and a `grep` that halts on a placeholder.

### Task U1.1: Verify/recreate the worktree `data/` symlink farm

**Files:**
- Modify (environment only, not repo-tracked): `data/` (repo-root symlink farm into `/media/user/data/babylon-data/`)
- Test: none (this is an environment precondition, not application code — see rationale below)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `tools/data_doctor.sh` (existing, unmodified) — the project's own loud data-pathway gate.
- Produces: a resolving `data/sqlite/marxist-data-3NF.sqlite` path that Task U1.2's export script reads via `babylon.reference.database.get_normalized_session_factory()`, and that Tasks U1.6/U1.8's `@pytest.mark.requires_reference_db` tests need.

This is a one-time environment-setup step, not application code — the repo already ships the exact checker this step must satisfy (`tools/data_doctor.sh`, wired as `mise run data:doctor`). Per the DRY rule ("reuse over recreation"), writing a second pytest reimplementation of that checker would be pure duplication, so this task drives the existing tool directly instead of a fabricated red test.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the existing data-pathway doctor to see current state**
Run: `mise run data:doctor`
Expected: either `data-doctor: healthy — drive at /media/user/data, trove + symlinks resolve, Postgres on the drive.` (farm already present — skip to Step 5), OR a line starting `DATA-DOCTOR FAIL: repo symlink ... dangles` / `... data/sqlite is a real dir/file, not a trove symlink` (farm missing or broken — continue to Step 3).
- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the specific failure (only if Step 1 failed)**
Run: `ls -la data/ 2>&1; readlink -e data/sqlite/marxist-data-3NF.sqlite 2>&1`
Expected: `ls: cannot access 'data/': No such file or directory` (farm absent) or a dangling-symlink error from `readlink -e` (farm present but broken).
- [ ] **Step 3: Recreate the farm (only if Step 1 failed)**
```bash
mkdir -p data
for entry in /home/user/projects/game/babylon/data/*; do
  name="$(basename "$entry")"
  target="$(readlink "$entry")"
  ln -sfn "$target" "data/$name"
done
```
This mirrors the main checkout's own farm (`/home/user/projects/game/babylon/data/*`, each entry a symlink into `/media/user/data/babylon-data/<name>`) entry-for-entry, so the worktree gets the identical set of 28 topic symlinks (`bea`, `bls`, `qcew`, `sqlite`, `tiger`, …) rather than a single fragile indirection through the other worktree.
- [ ] **Step 4: Re-run the doctor to confirm**
Run: `mise run data:doctor`
Expected: `data-doctor: healthy — drive at /media/user/data, trove + symlinks resolve, Postgres on the drive.`
- [ ] **Step 5: No commit**
`data/` is untracked local environment state (`git status --short data` reports `?? data`), not a repository change — `tools/data_doctor.sh` explicitly treats it as machine-local. Nothing to stage or commit. Proceed directly to Task U1.2.

### Task U1.2: Write the one-off Vol III FRED fixture export script + generate the committed fixture

**Files:**
- Create: `tools/export_vol3_fred_fixture.py`
- Create: `tests/fixtures/vol3_fred_series.json` (generated by running the script against the real reference DB, then committed)
- Test: `tests/unit/tools/test_export_vol3_fred_fixture.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `babylon.domain.economics.factory.load_fred_series_from_db(session_factory) -> dict[str, dict[int, float]]` (existing, `src/babylon/domain/economics/factory.py:253-332`); `babylon.reference.database.get_normalized_session_factory`.
- Produces: `tests/fixtures/vol3_fred_series.json` with shape `{"<SERIES_ID>": {"<year>": <float>}}` for the 10 series `FEDFUNDS, DGS10, BAA10Y, TCMDO, GFDEBTN, NCBEILQ027S, B230RC0Q173SBEA, A054RC1Q027SBEA, CPIAUCSL, GDPDEF` — the exact fixture Task U1.3 reads.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python

### Task U1.3: Wire the committed FRED fixture into `tools/regression_test.py`'s `calculator_overrides`

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/regression_test.py:71-77` (constants), `:99` (after `create_scenario`, before `CheckpointData`), `:540-615` (`_run_scenario_ticks`)
- Test: `tests/unit/tools/test_regression_test_vol3_wiring.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `tests/fixtures/vol3_fred_series.json` (Task U1.2); `babylon.domain.economics.factory.create_financial_services(fred_series_cache=...) -> dict[str, Any]`.
- Precondition (verify before Step 1): `run_scenario` (tools/regression_test.py:618) delegates to `_run_scenario_ticks` (:540). Confirm with `rg -n -A12 "^def run_scenario" tools/regression_test.py`. If it does not delegate, the Step-1 test must call `rt._run_scenario_ticks` directly, and the overrides must be built in whichever function owns the tick loop.
- Produces: `_build_vol3_calculator_overrides() -> dict[str, Any]` — a module-level helper other regression-test tooling can reuse; `step(..., calculator_overrides=...)` now receives it every tick.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```

Companion documentation-accuracy fix — `src/babylon/sentinels/seam/registry.py:922-937` currently declares `tick_ground_rent` as permanently `NOT_YET_COMPUTED` because of Path B's dead adapter; after the repoint it is genuinely live on the same condition as its Group D siblings (`tick_interest_burden` etc.). Edit the entry:
```python

        payload="tick_ground_rent",
        wire_keys=("tick_ground_rent",),
        scope=SeamScope.TERRITORY,

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics/tick/test_graph_bridge.py`
Expected: PASS (all tests in the file, including the unmodified `test_writes_default_financial_attrs_when_none` which stays `0.0` either way)

Also verify the static seam gate stays green:
Run: `mise run check:seams`
Expected: exit 0 (`SeamEntry.payload="tick_ground_rent"` is unchanged, so `check_tick_payloads_exist` still finds it in the write-set)

Also confirm the intended convergence (design §3.1): run `poetry run python tools/validate_detroit.py` and verify its reported `surplus.ground_rent` now equals the `tick_ground_rent` node attribute for Wayne. This is an INTENDED outcome, not a regression — record both values in the commit body.

### Task U1.6: Wire `TensorRegistry` + Vol III financial services into `headless_runner._build_economics_overrides`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/engine/headless_runner/runner.py:35` (typing import), `:83-87` (module constant), `:906-1000` (`_build_economics_overrides`)
- Test: `tests/unit/engine/headless_runner/test_gamma_wiring.py` (existing file — append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `TensorRegistry`, `MarxianHydrator`, `SQLiteQCEWSource`, `DepartmentMapper.from_yaml`, `StubBEASource` (all existing, same construction pattern as `web/game/engine_bridge.py:_build_capital_calculator`); `create_financial_services`, `load_fred_series_from_db` (`src/babylon/domain/economics/factory.py`).
- Produces: `_build_economics_overrides(..., scope_fips: frozenset[str] | None = None)` — new keyword param; when provided alongside `session_factory`, `overrides["tensor_registry"]` and the 11 Vol III financial calculator keys are populated. Task U1.7 threads `config.scope_fips` into this from `run()`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
def test_build_economics_overrides_wires_tensor_registry_and_financial_services() -> None:
    """U1 (vol3-money-scissors): tensor_registry + Vol III financial

    (domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py:1547,1599) read
    `getattr(services, "tensor_registry", None)` as permanently None, so
    `total_surplus` never exceeds 0 and `surplus_distribution` never

Expected: FAIL with `TypeError: _build_economics_overrides() got an unexpected keyword argument 'scope_fips'`
- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Edit `src/babylon/engine/headless_runner/runner.py:35`:
```python
from typing import Any, Final
```

Edit `src/babylon/engine/headless_runner/runner.py` — add a module constant near the existing ones (after `_AUDIT_SEVERITY_MAP`, before `class RunnerError`):
```python
#: Real Vol III FRED coverage horizon (design doc §1.4: all ten Vol III
#: series terminate at 2024; GFDEBTN starts 2010). Mirrors
#: web/game/engine_bridge.py's ``_CAPITAL_HYDRATION_YEARS``.
_TENSOR_HYDRATION_YEARS: Final[tuple[int, ...]] = tuple(range(2010, 2025))
```

Edit `_build_economics_overrides`'s signature (`:906-910`):
```python
def _build_economics_overrides(
    session_factory: Any = None,
    event_bus: Any = None,
    defines: Any = None,
    scope_fips: frozenset[str] | None = None,
) -> tuple[dict[str, Any], Any]:
```

Add a `scope_fips` entry to the docstring's `Args:` (after the existing `defines:` entry, before `Returns:`):
```python
        scope_fips: Optional set of county FIPS this run computes over. When
            provided (with ``session_factory``), a ``TensorRegistry`` is
            hydrated for these counties over
            ``_TENSOR_HYDRATION_YEARS`` (2010-2024) and exposed as
            ``overrides["tensor_registry"]``, and the Vol III financial
            calculators (:func:`~babylon.domain.economics.factory.create_financial_services`)
            are wired from the reference DB's FRED tables — so
            ``surplus_distribution`` (s = p + i + r + t) genuinely computes
            per county instead of staying permanently ``None``
            (``services.tensor_registry is None`` gate,
            ``domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py:1547,1599,1599``).
```

### Task U1.8: Extract `_build_tensor_registry` + wire `tensor_registry` into `engine_bridge._bridge_economics_overrides`

**Files:**
- Modify: `web/game/engine_bridge.py` — the `_CAPITAL_CALCULATOR_CACHE` / `_build_capital_calculator` block, and the `if fips_codes:` block inside `_bridge_economics_overrides`. **Located by quoted anchor, not line number** (see the base note below).
- Test: `tests/unit/web/test_tensor_registry_wiring.py`

> **BASE NOTE (deconfliction, 2026-07-18) — anchors are base-agnostic.**
> A sibling branch, `fix/null-play-coupling` (fog-of-war / player-vision), also edits
> `web/game/engine_bridge.py` and is **not yet merged to `dev`**. It inserts ~699 lines
> *above* this task's edit region, which shifts every line number here by roughly **+439**.
> **Every textual anchor this task uses is byte-identical on `dev` and on
> `fix/null-play-coupling`**, verified by `grep -F` (exactly one hit on each ref) plus a
> full-block byte diff. That is why the line numbers were removed: the quoted anchors below
> locate the edit correctly on *either* base, so this task does not care which branch lands first.
>
> *How to tell which base you are on:* `grep -c '_resolve_player_org_id' web/game/engine_bridge.py`
> → `0` means the sibling has **not** landed (you are on plain `dev`); `1` means it **has**.
> Either way, proceed unchanged.
>
> *Merge safety (verified, not assumed):* the sibling's nearest insertion
> (`_current_intel_aging_ticks`) ends ~130 lines above this edit region — far outside
> three-way-merge context. A `git merge-file` simulation of this exact edit against
> `fix/null-play-coupling` produced **0 conflicts**, with `_build_tensor_registry` and their
> `_resolve_player_org_id`/fog helpers coexisting intact.
>
> *If an anchor below is NOT found verbatim:* *STOP — do not improvise a nearby line.* It means
> the sibling (or `dev`) has since edited this specific region, which is new information the plan
> does not cover. Re-verify with
> `git show dev:web/game/engine_bridge.py | grep -F '<anchor>'` and the same against
> `fix/null-play-coupling`, then escalate with which ref lost the anchor.
>
> *Deliberately NOT adopted:* the sibling extracts `_resolve_player_org_id` / `_is_player_org`
> helpers. They are genuinely good, but they serve **their** fog feature — this branch calls the
> player-org heuristic nowhere. Copying them here would manufacture a duplicate-definition
> conflict at merge time in a region where we currently conflict **zero**. Let their branch own them.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new — reuses the exact `TensorRegistry`/`MarxianHydrator`/`SQLiteQCEWSource`/`DepartmentMapper`/`StubBEASource`/`get_reference_session` construction already in `_build_capital_calculator` (the `registry = TensorRegistry()` … `registry.hydrate_counties(...)` body of that function).
- Produces: `_build_tensor_registry(fips_codes: tuple[str, ...]) -> Any` (new, cached, module-level) — `_build_capital_calculator` now calls it instead of duplicating hydration; `_bridge_economics_overrides` gains `overrides["tensor_registry"]` under the same `if fips_codes:` gate as `capital_calculator`, so every real web session finally exposes `services.tensor_registry` (design doc §1.1: "no — built :6268, consumed only by CapitalStockCalculator").

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
"""U1 (vol3-money-scissors): wire tensor_registry into the web bridge.

Before this fix, _bridge_economics_overrides built a TensorRegistry only
inside _build_capital_calculator, wrapped it in a CapitalStockCalculator, and
discarded the registry itself — services.tensor_registry stayed None for
every web session, so `_get_county_surplus`/`_get_county_profit_rate`
(domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py:1547,1599) always returned None,
and surplus_distribution (s = p + i + r + t) never computed for the playable
game (design doc §1.1, "Vol III county layer: national only").

_build_tensor_registry is factored out of _build_capital_calculator so BOTH
capital_calculator and the standalone tensor_registry override share ONE
hydration pass over the reference DB, not two.

and ends with the closing lines of `_build_capital_calculator`:
```python

### Task U1.9: Real-run acceptance — `s = p + i + r + t` evaluates, and holds (SC-001)

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/integration/economics/test_vol3_surplus_distribution_live.py`
- Modify: `tests/integration/economics/conftest.py` — append one new section
  (a `TYPE_CHECKING` import block + the `build_wayne_world_state()` builder).
  No existing fixture in that file is touched.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `_build_economics_overrides(session_factory=..., scope_fips=...)` (U1.6);
  `babylon.engine.simulation_engine.step`, `_restore_graph_context`, `_DEFAULT_ENGINE`;
  `babylon.engine.services.ServiceContainer`; `babylon.engine.context.TickContext`;
  `TICK_DYNAMICS_KEY`, `_reconstruct_tick_state`
  (`domain/economics/tick/graph_bridge.py`, both in that module's `__all__`);
  `DISTRIBUTION_EPSILON` (`distribution/types.py`);
  `create_wayne_county_scenario` (`babylon.engine.scenarios`, **existing** — it
  already returns exactly the `(WorldState, SimulationConfig, GameDefines)`
  triple this task needs; `_legacy_wayne.py:577`).
- Produces: `build_wayne_world_state()` in `tests/integration/economics/conftest.py`
  (Step 1b — a plain module-level function, deliberately **not** a pytest
  fixture, so `_run_to_year_boundary_capturing_graph` can import it by module
  path); plus the standing proof of U1's three acceptance criteria. Nothing else
  consumes them.

> **Observation-point note (read before writing Step 1 — it is why this test does
> NOT call `read_tick_state_from_graph` on a post-`step` `WorldState`).**
> Three separate mechanisms destroy the quantities this task must observe if the
> tests read them off `step(...)`'s returned `WorldState`:
>
> 1. **`tick_dynamics` is not a `WorldState` field.** `WorldState.to_graph`
>    (`models/world_state.py:608`) stamps `economy`, `state_finances`,
>    `contradiction_frames`, `opposition_states`, `events`, `event_log`,
>    `institution_relations`, the field stack, `player_org_id`,
>    `wealth_distribution`, `market`, `market_county` — and nothing else.
>    `graph.graph["tick_dynamics"]` lives only inside a tick; it is ferried
>    across the boundary in `persistent_context["_tick_dynamics"]` by
>    `_save_graph_context` (`engine/simulation_engine.py:446-464`) and replayed by
>    `_restore_graph_context` (`:428-443`). So
>    `read_tick_state_from_graph(returned_state.to_graph())` reads
>    `get_graph_attr("tick_dynamics")` → `None` → returns `None`.
> 2. **`tick_`-prefixed node attrs do not survive `from_graph`.**
>    `_reconstruct_territory` (`models/world_state.py:232-252`) filters out every
>    key that `startswith(("tick_", "flow_"))`, so a `Territory` carries no
>    `tick_ground_rent` and `to_graph` cannot re-emit one.
> 3. **`read_tick_state_from_graph` drops the Vol III payload even on a live
>    graph.** Its per-territory reconstruction
>    (`domain/economics/tick/graph_bridge.py:201-290`) builds each
>    `CountyEconomicState` from an explicit field list that contains **no**
>    `surplus_distribution` and **no** `rent_extraction`. Its `county_states`
>    fallback fires only when *no* territory node carries `tick_capital_stock` —
>    which is exactly not the case on a freshly-ticked graph. Reading through it
>    would report "the Vol III county layer is still dark" against perfectly
>    correct U1 wiring.
>
> The honest observation point is therefore the **live post-tick graph's**
> `tick_dynamics` attribute, whose `"county_states"` entry holds the real
> `CountyEconomicState` objects `write_tick_state_to_graph` put there
> (`graph_bridge.py:57-68`), reconstructed with `_reconstruct_tick_state`
> (`graph_bridge.py:292-325`) — the same helper `Simulation.get_time_series()`
> uses. `_run_to_year_boundary_capturing_graph()` below returns that graph.
> **Do not "simplify" it back to `_run_to_year_boundary().to_graph()`.**

The test above imports `build_wayne_world_state` from

must be written before Step 2, or the module raises `ImportError` at collection and
Step 2's red is unreachable. It is a plain module-level function, not a pytest
fixture, precisely so the test can import it by module path.

Edit `tests/integration/economics/conftest.py` — add `TYPE_CHECKING` to the stdlib
imports, immediately after the existing `from pathlib import Path`:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
```

Then, immediately after the existing `from babylon.domain.economics.hydrator import
MarxianHydrator` line (i.e. after the last top-level `babylon` import, before the
`# ===` DATABASE PATH CANDIDATES banner), add the type-only import block:
```python
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from babylon.config.defines import GameDefines
    from babylon.models.config import SimulationConfig
    from babylon.models.world_state import WorldState
```

Then append this section to the END of the file (after the closing
`# IMPERIAL RENT FIXTURES (REMOVED post-Spec 057)` comment block):
```python

WAYNE_COUNTY_FIPS = "26163"


def build_wayne_world_state() -> tuple[WorldState, SimulationConfig, GameDefines]:
    """Build a Wayne-County-scoped world the engine can tick past a year boundary.

    Reuse over recreation: :func:`babylon.engine.scenarios.create_wayne_county_scenario`
    (``engine/scenarios/_legacy_wayne.py:577``) already returns exactly the
    ``(WorldState, SimulationConfig, GameDefines)`` triple, already populated with
    the H3 res-5 hex territories, social classes, relationships and the player /
    state-apparatus organizations that the 30 systems need in order to run. This
    helper does ONE thing on top of it, and that one thing is load-bearing for
    U1: it stamps the real county identity onto every territory.

    Why the stamp is required: ``TickDynamicsSystem._get_territory_fips``
    (``domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py:366-382``) derives the county key
    from ``node.attributes.get("county_fips") or node.id``. The stock Wayne
    scenario sets no ``county_fips`` at all, so every H3 cell id (``85...fffff``)
    becomes its own pseudo-county. U1.6 hydrates the ``TensorRegistry`` for
    ``"26163"`` and nothing else, so every one of those pseudo-counties would miss
    the registry, ``_get_county_surplus`` would return ``None``, and
    ``surplus_distribution`` would stay ``None`` — for a reason that has nothing
    to do with the wiring this task exists to prove. That is exactly the
    green-test-over-a-dead-feature trap the fixture-vocabulary rule warns about.

    ``county_fips`` is a real ``Territory`` model field
    (``models/entities/territory.py:75``), ``WorldState.to_graph`` writes it onto
    the node via ``**territory.model_dump()``, and it is NOT in
    ``TERRITORY_EXCLUDED_FIELDS`` — so it survives the ``to_graph``/``from_graph``
    round trip that ``simulation_engine.step`` performs on every tick.

    Tick 0 is deliberate: ``0 % WEEKS_PER_YEAR == 0``, so the very first ``step``
    is a year-boundary tick that bootstraps county states at the default
    ``base_year`` of 2010 (``_determine_year``, same module ``:350-364``); the
    caller then drives 52 ``step`` calls (ticks 0-51) and executes tick 52 — the
    next boundary — as its capturing pass, recomputing at 2011. Both years
    sit inside U1.6's ``_TENSOR_HYDRATION_YEARS`` (2010-2024), so both find real
    QCEW/FRED-backed data rather than a ``NoDataSentinel``.

    Determinism (Constitution III.7): every input is fixed — the scenario's
    default ``extraction_efficiency``/``repression_level``, the default
    ``SimulationConfig`` (and therefore the default ``rng_seed``), and a
    deterministic dict comprehension over ``state.territories``. Two calls
    produce equal worlds.

    Returns:
        ``(state, config, defines)`` — a tick-0 ``WorldState`` whose every
        territory carries ``county_fips == "26163"``, the scenario's
        ``SimulationConfig``, and the scenario's ``GameDefines``.

against a checkout WITHOUT U1.6/U1.7 (verify by `git stash`-ing those two commits,
running, then `git stash pop`). This is the characterization proof that the
criterion was previously unmet.

If you instead see `ImportError: cannot import name 'build_wayne_world_state' from
'tests.integration.economics.conftest'`, Step 1b was skipped or its append landed
in the wrong file. Go back and do Step 1b. Do NOT proceed, and do NOT "fix" it by
deleting the import — a collection error is not a red phase.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
No new production code — U1.2–U1.8 supply every line. (Step 1b's conftest builder
is test-support scaffolding, not production code; it is already written.) If any
test here fails after U1.8 has landed, the defect is in U1.6/U1.7/U1.8's wiring,
not in this test. Do NOT weaken an assertion to make it pass.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/integration/economics/test_vol3_surplus_distribution_live.py`
Expected: PASS (3 passed).

### Task U2.1: Stop fabricating year=2040 on the live MELT path (NationalTickParameters year ceiling)

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/tick/types.py:228`
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py:526-540`

Interest rate, fictitious capital, and surplus distribution calculators
constructed their year-bounded (ge=2007,le=2040) Pydantic models with a
raw, unguarded year — currently masked only by FRED data absence past
2024, not by design. Add a shared year_within_modeled_range() guard
(tensor.py) that degrades out-of-range years to NoDataSentinel BEFORE
any data lookup or construction, and make DebtAccumulation.update carry
its state forward unchanged (never fabricated) for the same reason.

- Test: `tests/unit/economics/distribution/test_calculator.py:59` (docstring reference only)
- Test: `tests/integration/economics/test_vol3_surplus_distribution_live.py` (U1.9's file — rewrite import + 2 call sites)

**Blast radius — verified by `rg` over `src tests` before authoring, not assumed.** This task
deletes five module-level names, and every one of them is re-exported from its package
`__init__.py` and listed in that package's `__all__`. Deleting them without threading the
packages breaks **package import**, not one call site: `from babylon.domain.economics.distribution
import ...` then raises `ImportError` at collection for every test under that tree. Three of the
five are also used *internally* by the module that declares them
(`distribution/types.py:87`, `counter_tendencies/types.py:119,131`,
`credit_cycle.py:126,143,145`), and four are used by already-shipped test files — including
`tests/integration/economics/test_vol3_surplus_distribution_live.py`, which **Task U1.9 ships
earlier in this same plan**. Every one of those sites is edited in Step 3 below.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `GameDefines.load_default()` / `GameDefines.load_from_yaml()` (`babylon.config.defines`), the `_from_yaml_dict`/`build_yaml` auto-discovery over `GameDefines.model_fields` (`tools/generate_defines_config.py` — no changes needed there, it introspects the schema).
- Produces: `GameDefines.capital_vol3: CapitalVolumeIIIDefines` with fields `debt_spiral_threshold`, `distribution_epsilon`, `counter_tendency_weights`, `imperial_rent_reference_scale`, `profit_rate_fallback`, `national_county_count`, `default_rate_estimate`, `housing_capitalization_rate_default` — Task U2.4 wires the last four into `tick/system/__init__.py` and `factory.py` via `services.defines.capital_vol3.*`.
- Produces (renames): five module-level constants become defines-backed accessor **functions** —
  `distribution.types.debt_spiral_threshold()`, `distribution.types.distribution_epsilon()`,
  `counter_tendencies.types.counter_tendency_weights()`,
  `counter_tendencies.types.imperial_rent_reference_scale()`,
  `credit.types.stagnation_credit_growth()`. Each takes an optional `defines: GameDefines | None`
  and falls back to the process-cached default. The ALL-CAPS names are **deleted**; the package
  `__all__`s carry the lowercase names instead.

- [ ] **Step 0: Enumerate every call site before editing**
Run this sweep and reconcile its output against this task's **Files** block before editing a single
line. Scope is `src tests` — **not** `src/babylon`: four of the call sites are in already-shipped
test files, and one of those files is shipped by Task U1.9 of this same plan.
```bash
rg -n "DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD|DISTRIBUTION_EPSILON|COUNTER_TENDENCY_WEIGHTS|IMPERIAL_RENT_REFERENCE_SCALE|STAGNATION_CREDIT_GROWTH" src tests
```
Expected: 23 matches across 7 files at the time of authoring, plus the U1.9 integration test's 3.
If the sweep reports a file that is **not** in the Files block, STOP and add it — the accessor
conversion must thread every one, and an unthreaded package `__init__.py` is an `ImportError` at
collection, not a localized failure.
- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```
Also regenerate the canonical YAML:
```bash
poetry run python tools/generate_defines_config.py
```
- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests to verify they pass**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/config/test_capital_vol3_defines.py tests/unit/economics/distribution/test_distribution_types.py tests/unit/economics/counter_tendencies/test_types.py tests/unit/economics/credit/test_credit_cycle.py tests/unit/economics/distribution/test_calculator.py tests/unit/config/test_constants_sync.py::TestDefinesYamlSingleSourceOfTruth`
Expected: PASS — 5 in `test_capital_vol3_defines.py` (2 defaults + 3 stagnation), 19 in
`test_distribution_types.py` (16 pre-existing + 3 appended), 21 in `test_types.py` (18 pre-existing,
4 of them rewritten onto the accessors, + 3 appended), 17 in `test_credit_cycle.py` (all
pre-existing, import + 3 call sites rewritten), plus `test_calculator.py` and the sync guard
unchanged.
- [ ] **Step 4b: Re-run U1.9's integration file — this task edited it**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/integration/economics/test_vol3_surplus_distribution_live.py`
Expected: PASS (3 passed) — the same 3 U1.9 turned green, now importing `distribution_epsilon`
instead of the deleted `DISTRIBUTION_EPSILON`. If this errors at collection, the import rewrite in
Step 1 was not applied; a green Step 4 does not cover it, because that file is in the integration
tier and `test:unit` never collects it.
- [ ] **Step 4c: Prove no deleted name survives anywhere**
Run: `rg -n "DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD|DISTRIBUTION_EPSILON|COUNTER_TENDENCY_WEIGHTS|IMPERIAL_RENT_REFERENCE_SCALE|STAGNATION_CREDIT_GROWTH" src tests`
Expected: **exactly one match** —
`tests/unit/config/test_capital_vol3_defines.py`'s `assert "STAGNATION_CREDIT_GROWTH" not in source`,
which is the string literal that pins the deletion and must survive. Any *other* hit is an
unthreaded call site — an `ImportError` waiting for whichever suite collects that file next. Then
run `mise run check:quick` to confirm the deleted `from typing import Final` in
`distribution/types.py` left no unused-import lint failure and that the two `:func:` docstring
xrefs resolve.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(config): add GameDefines.capital_vol3, migrate five Vol III constants to accessors

DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD, DISTRIBUTION_EPSILON, COUNTER_TENDENCY_WEIGHTS,
and IMPERIAL_RENT_REFERENCE_SCALE were module-level Finals a
defines.yaml edit could never reach. Migrate them into a new
GameDefines.capital_vol3 category (same default values, zero behavior
change) and regenerate defines.yaml. Each becomes a lowercase accessor
function reading the defines at CALL time, with a first-use-cached
process default; the ALL-CAPS names are deleted and every consumer is
threaded — both package __init__.py re-exports, distribution/types.py's
own distribution_complete field, counter_tendencies/types.py's
net_counter_tendency, credit_cycle.py's two transition guards, and four
already-shipped test files including U1.9's integration acceptance test.

Also convert credit/types.py:95's STAGNATION_CREDIT_GROWTH, which read
bare GameDefines() instead of load_default() — a defines.yaml override
silently had no effect. It reads crisis, not capital_vol3, so no new
field is added; leaving it as an import-time snapshot would have
enshrined in this commit the exact anti-pattern the commit removes.

### Task U2.4: Move the tick/system + factory magic numbers into `capital_vol3`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py:1451,1511,1520`
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/factory.py:335-337,459-462`
- Modify: `tests/unit/economics/tick/conftest.py:36-55` (`MockTensor` gains `total_s`)
- Test: `tests/unit/economics/tick/test_financial_integration.py` (append)
- Test: `tests/unit/economics/test_create_financial_services.py` (create)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `services.defines.capital_vol3.{profit_rate_fallback,national_county_count,default_rate_estimate,housing_capitalization_rate_default}` (from U2.3); `GameDefines.load_default()`; `ServiceContainer.create(defines=..., **overrides)` (`babylon.engine.services`).
- Produces: `create_financial_services(fred_series_cache=None, *, defines: GameDefines | None = None)` — U1's `_legacy.py` call site (`create_financial_services(fred_series_cache=fred_cache)`) is unaffected (new param is optional/keyword).

housing ground-rent capitalization rate (0.05) were bare literals in
tick/system/__init__.py and factory.py. Same values, now moddable via
defines.yaml (Constitution III.1). Also removes factory.py's stale
'overridden per-tick' comment — DefaultHousingDecompositionCalculator
captures the rate once at construction and never reassigns it.

### Task U2.6: Correct the stale Group C/D + market_scissors docstrings

**Files:**
- Modify: `web/game/engine_bridge.py` — three comment/docstring blocks (in `_carry_tick_dynamics_flows` and `_serialize_territory`), **located by the quoted BEFORE blocks in Step 3, not by line number** (see the base note below).
- Modify: `src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py` — module docstring line 1, the `PHASE 1 SCOPE` section, and the `MarketScissorsSystem` class docstring; again located by quoted BEFORE blocks.
- Test: `tests/unit/web/test_engine_bridge.py` (append)
- Test: `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py` (append)

> **BASE NOTE (deconfliction, 2026-07-18) — this task is still necessary, and base-agnostic.**
> The sibling branch `fix/null-play-coupling` (fog-of-war, unmerged) touches **both** files this
> task edits. Checked explicitly: it did **not** fix these stale docstrings — the
> `both gating services are unwired` / `NOT_YET_COMPUTED — never relabeled live` /
> `Phase 1 SHADOW ONLY` text is still present verbatim, exactly once, on `dev` **and** on
> `fix/null-play-coupling`. So U2.6 is not redundant and must still run.
>
> All six BEFORE blocks below are byte-identical across the two refs, so they locate correctly on
> either base. Line numbers were removed because the sibling shifts `engine_bridge.py` by ~+439/+517.
>
> *How to tell which base you are on:* `grep -c '_resolve_player_org_id' web/game/engine_bridge.py`
> → `0` = sibling not landed (plain `dev`); `1` = landed. Proceed unchanged either way.
>
> *One tight spot, verified safe.* On `fix/null-play-coupling`, `_serialize_territory` ends
> `payload = {` where `dev` has `return {` (they post-process through `apply_fog`). That line sits
> **two lines below** the docstring this task rewrites — close, but the intervening
> `territory_id = t.id` plus the retained `"""` give three-way merge enough common context: a
> `git merge-file` simulation of this exact edit against their branch produced **0 conflicts**,
> preserving both their `payload = {` and our `CORRECTED 2026-07-18` text. Do **not** extend the
> replacement past the closing `"""` — including `return {` in the edit is what would break it.
>
> *`market_scissors.py` has real concurrent edits.* The sibling swapped four raw
> `node_type="territory"` / `"social_class"` strings for `NodeType.TERRITORY` / `NodeType.SOCIAL_CLASS`
> (the `_node_type` vocabulary rule in CLAUDE.md). Those hunks are at unrelated lines and merge
> clean with this task's three docstring edits (simulated: 0 conflicts, `NodeType.*` and the
> ADR078 wording both survive). Nothing to do — just do not "helpfully" revert them if you see
> them post-merge; the enum form is correct.
>
> *If a BEFORE block is NOT found verbatim:* *STOP — do not pattern-match a near approximation.*
> Re-verify against both refs
> (`git show dev:<file> | grep -F '<anchor>'`, same for `fix/null-play-coupling`) and escalate
> with which ref lost it. A docstring this task claims is stale may have been corrected by
> someone else, in which case the right move is to *shrink* this task, not to re-fix it.

### Task U2.7: Mark `RentCategory` dormant (zero behavioral consumers)

**Files:**

### Task U2.8: Cross tick 1612 in a real loop — the year ceiling is a live crash, prove it dead

**Files:**

### Task U3.2: Wire `_compute_national_financial_state` to instantiate + publish `NationalFinancialParameters`

**Files:**
- Modify: `tests/unit/economics/tick/conftest.py:209-211` (insert two new mock calculator classes), `:9-25` (imports)
- Modify: `tests/unit/economics/tick/test_system.py:11-48` (imports), append new test class at EOF (after line 2228)
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py:40-74` (imports), `:202-208` (call site), `:1340-1412` (`_compute_financial_layer` + `_compute_national_financial_state`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR`, `write_national_financial_state_to_graph`, `read_national_financial_state_from_graph` (Task U3.1); `NationalFinancialParameters` (`tick/types.py:454-493`)
- Produces: `TickDynamicsSystem._compute_national_financial_state(services, year, graph) -> tuple[float, float, FictitiousCapitalStock | None]` (adds `graph`; the 3-tuple `(national_rate, baa_spread, fictitious)` contract from U2.5 is PRESERVED — U3 must NOT revert it). `credit_state` is populated by the new Task U3.4, which U5.7 depends on. — this is the exact method U4/U5/U6 will extend to also populate `credit_state`/`counter_tendencies`/`monetary_adjustment`; `MockInterestRateCalculator`, `MockFictitiousCapitalCalculator` test fixtures (reused by Task U3.3 and by U1).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

In `tests/unit/economics/tick/conftest.py`, first add an import (insert before the `dynamics.types` import at line 15, keeping the block alphabetical):

```python

### Task U3.3: Round-trip proof — a CONSEQUENCE-phase System reads it in the same tick

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/unit/economics/tick/test_financial_state_consequence_roundtrip.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR`, `read_national_financial_state_from_graph` (Task U3.1); `TickDynamicsSystem` publishing via `_compute_national_financial_state` (Task U3.2); `MockInterestRateCalculator`, `MockFictitiousCapitalCalculator` (Task U3.2); `_make_services`, `_make_graph_with_state` (`tests/unit/economics/tick/test_system.py`); `SystemBase` (`src/babylon/kernel/system_base.py:58-117`), `TickPartition.CONSEQUENCE` (`src/babylon/kernel/tick_partition.py`)
- Produces: a permanent regression pin proving the U3 acceptance criterion — no new production names for later units to consume.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test**

Create `tests/unit/economics/tick/test_financial_state_consequence_roundtrip.py`:

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

**Step 2a:** Comment out the line `write_national_financial_state_to_graph(graph, financial_params)` in `src/babylon/domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py` (inside `_compute_national_financial_state`).

**Step 2b:** Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics/tick/test_financial_state_consequence_roundtrip.py`
Expected: FAIL with `AssertionError: assert 'national_financial' in {}` at the post-`material_base_system.step()` assertion — proving the CONSEQUENCE-phase read genuinely depends on U3.2's publish rather than incidental state. If this fails to fail, the defect is in U3.1 or U3.2, not here — do not "fix" this test to make it pass; go back and fix the wiring.

- [ ] **Step 3: Restore the implementation**
Run: `git checkout -- src/babylon/domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py`
Expected: GREEN — Tasks U3.1 and U3.2 already implemented every production line this test exercises (`NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR`, both graph_bridge functions, and `_compute_national_financial_state`'s publish call), so restoring the commented-out line makes the round-trip contract hold end-to-end again; this task adds zero new production code. Re-read `_SpyConsequenceSystem.step()` and confirm it reads via the public `read_national_financial_state_from_graph` API (not a private/internal attribute), so the proof is representative of how a real future consumer (U4's anchor, U5/U6's oppositions) will read it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics/tick/test_financial_state_consequence_roundtrip.py`
Expected: PASS (unchanged from Step 2 — confirms nothing regressed between steps).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "test(economics): pin CONSEQUENCE-phase cross-System same-tick read of national financial state

U3.3: regression guard for the design doc's U3 acceptance criterion —
a second SystemBase at TickPartition.CONSEQUENCE reads what
TickDynamicsSystem (MATERIAL_BASE) published, on the same graph object,
same tick, no WorldState round-trip. No production code changed.

### Task U3.4: Compute and publish `CreditState` (the `credit` opposition's only input)

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py` (`_compute_national_financial_state`)
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/factory.py` (`create_financial_services` return dict)
- Modify: `src/babylon/kernel/services.py`, `src/babylon/engine/services.py` (new service key)
- Test: `tests/unit/economics/tick/test_system.py` (append to `TestComputeNationalFinancialState`;
  add `from tests.unit.economics.credit.conftest import MockCreditAggregateSource` to the
  import block — that fixture lives in a sibling package's `conftest.py`, and pytest conftests
  are not cross-package importable by name, so it needs an explicit module-path import)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CreditState` (`babylon.domain.economics.credit.types:148`, fields `year`,
  `total_credit`, `credit_expansion_rate`, `default_rate`, `spread_to_treasuries`,
  `phase`; computed `credit_fragility = default_rate * spread_to_treasuries`);
  `CreditAggregateSource.get_total_credit` (`credit/data_sources.py:57`, wired as
  `FredCreditAggregateAdapter` over `TCMDO`);
  `services.defines.capital_vol3.default_rate_estimate` (U2.3);
  `InterestRateState.baa_spread`.
- Produces: `NationalFinancialParameters.credit_state` populated — the ONLY producer of the
  `credit_fragility` value `ContradictionSystem._credit_fragility` (U5.7) reads.

- [ ] **Step 0: Read the real API before writing anything (MANDATORY)**
Three plan auditors proposed three different producers for `CreditState`
(`credit_cycle_calculator.compute_credit_state`,
`credit_aggregate_source.get_total_credit`, `credit_cycle_detector.detect_credit_state`).
Only one exists. Run:
```bash
rg -n "class CreditState" -A 30 src/babylon/domain/economics/credit/types.py
rg -n "class DefaultCreditCycleDetector" -A 40 src/babylon/domain/economics/credit/
rg -n "class CreditAggregateSource\|FredCreditAggregateAdapter" -A 20 src/babylon/domain/economics/credit/data_sources.py
rg -n "credit_cycle\|credit_agg" src/babylon/domain/economics/factory.py
```
Adjust Step 3's helper body to the REAL signatures. **Do not adjust the Step 1
test's contract** — `credit_fragility == default_rate_estimate * baa_spread` is
what the `credit` opposition measures, whatever plumbing supplies the inputs.
- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
`MockCreditAggregateSource` lives in `tests/unit/economics/credit/conftest.py`, a
different package from this file — conftest fixtures are not cross-package
importable by name. Add the explicit module-path import to this file's import
block:
```python
from tests.unit.economics.credit.conftest import MockCreditAggregateSource
```
Then append these two tests to `TestComputeNationalFinancialState`:
```python
    def test_publishes_credit_state_with_a_real_fragility_index(self) -> None:
        """U3.4: the `credit` opposition (U5.2) measures default_rate * spread.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics/tick/test_system.py::TestComputeNationalFinancialState`
Expected: 1 failed, the rest passed. `test_publishes_credit_state_with_a_real_fragility_index`
fails with `assert None is not None` (`published.credit_state` is never populated).
`test_credit_state_is_none_without_an_interest_state` passes already — `credit_state` defaults
to `None` before Step 3's implementation exists, which is what that test asserts — so it is not
part of this task's red phase.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Add `CreditState` to the `credit.types` import block in
`src/babylon/domain/economics/tick/system/__init__.py`, then insert this helper
immediately before `_compute_national_financial_state`:
```python
    @staticmethod
    def _build_credit_state(
        services: ServicesProtocol,
        year: int,
        interest_state: InterestRateState | None,
    ) -> CreditState | None:
        """Assemble the national credit state from the FRED credit aggregate.

        measure the ``credit`` opposition (accommodation ⟷ fragility) is bound
        to; without this the opposition reads absent forever and the declared
        ``credit -> financial`` transforms edge permanently demotes ``financial``.

        Returns:
            ``None`` — never a fabricated zero (III.11) — when no interest state
            supplies the spread, or when no credit aggregate source supplies
            total credit for ``year``.
        """
        if interest_state is None:
            return None
        source = getattr(services, "credit_aggregate_source", None)
        if source is None:
            return None
        total_credit = source.get_total_credit(year)
        if total_credit is None:
            return None
        return CreditState(
            year=year,
            total_credit=total_credit,
            default_rate=services.defines.capital_vol3.default_rate_estimate,
            spread_to_treasuries=interest_state.baa_spread,
        )
```
Then, in `_compute_national_financial_state`, replace:
```python
        financial_params = NationalFinancialParameters(
            interest_rate_state=interest_state,
            fictitious_capital=fictitious,
        )
```
with:
```python
        financial_params = NationalFinancialParameters(
            interest_rate_state=interest_state,
            credit_state=self._build_credit_state(services, year, interest_state),
            fictitious_capital=fictitious,
        )
```
Finally, expose the adapter the helper reads. In
`src/babylon/domain/economics/factory.py`'s `create_financial_services`, add
`"credit_aggregate_source": credit_agg,` to the returned dict (the
`FredCreditAggregateAdapter` instance already built for
`DefaultFictitiousCapitalCalculator`), and add the matching
`credit_aggregate_source: Any` field to `src/babylon/kernel/services.py` beside
`credit_cycle_detector`, plus `credit_aggregate_source: Any = field(default=None)`,
the `create` kwarg, and the pass-through in `src/babylon/engine/services.py`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics/tick/test_system.py tests/unit/economics/tick/test_graph_bridge.py`
Expected: PASS.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(economics): compute and publish CreditState (the credit opposition's only input)

CreditState had zero production constructors — the model existed, nothing
built it. GraphInputs.credit_fragility was therefore permanently None, the
credit opposition permanently read (0,0), and the declared credit->financial
transforms edge permanently demoted \`financial\` from principal ranking.

### Task U4.1: `fictitious_anchor` — honest absence when the stock is missing

**Files:**
- Create: `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py`
- Test: `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `NoDataSentinel(fips: str, year: int, reason: str)` from `babylon.domain.economics.tensor` (falsy marker, `__slots__ = ("fips", "year", "reason")`); `FictitiousCapitalStock` from `babylon.domain.economics.credit.types` (frozen; fields `year` (ge=2007, le=2040), `government_debt`, `corporate_equity`, `corporate_debt`, `household_debt`, `derivatives_notional`; computed `total_claims`; method `ratio_to_real(real_gdp: float) -> float` returning `inf` when `real_gdp <= 0`).
- Produces: `babylon.domain.economics.monetary.anchor.fictitious_anchor(stock: FictitiousCapitalStock | None, real_output: float | None) -> float | NoDataSentinel`; module constants `NATIONAL_FIPS: Final[str] = "USA"` and `UNKNOWN_YEAR: Final[int] = 0`. U6 consumes `fictitious_anchor` to pull `fictitious_log` toward the real ratio.
- Deferred: `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/__init__.py` is NOT touched by this task — the anchor is imported by submodule path until U4.7 exports it. Do not add the export early; U4.7's red phase depends on `fictitious_anchor` being absent from `monetary.__all__`.
- Ordering note: U3 is a prerequisite of U6.8, not of this task — the anchor is a pure function of an already-resolved stock object and never reads `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

### Task U4.2: `fictitious_anchor` — the present path returns the real log ratio

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py` (no signature change; add nothing — this task proves the already-written present path)
- Test: `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `fictitious_anchor` from U4.1; `FictitiousCapitalStock.total_claims` (`government_debt + corporate_equity + corporate_debt + household_debt`; `derivatives_notional` excluded).
- Produces: nothing new — pins the numeric contract U6's `anchor_pull` term depends on.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
Append to `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py`:
```python
@pytest.mark.unit

### Task U4.3: `fictitious_anchor` — degenerate ratios are absence, not infinity

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py` (the `fictitious_anchor` body, between the `real_output is None` guard and the `return math.log(...)`)
- Test: `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `FictitiousCapitalStock.ratio_to_real`, which returns `float("inf")` when `real_gdp <= 0.0` — an infinity that would poison the oscillator, and `math.log(0.0)` which raises `ValueError`.
- Produces: `fictitious_anchor` now guarantees a finite float or a sentinel — never `inf`, `-inf`, `nan`, or a raised exception.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
Append to `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py`:
```python
@pytest.mark.unit

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py::TestFictitiousAnchorDegenerate`
Expected: FAIL — `test_zero_real_output_returns_sentinel` gets `inf` back from `math.log(inf)` instead of a `NoDataSentinel`, and `test_zero_total_claims_returns_sentinel` raises `ValueError: math domain error`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
In `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py`, replace the final statement of `fictitious_anchor`:
```python
    return math.log(stock.ratio_to_real(real_output))
```
with:
```python
    if real_output <= 0.0:
        return NoDataSentinel(

            reason=(
                f"fictitious_anchor: non-positive real output ({real_output}) "
                f"for {stock.year}; log-ratio undefined"

                "log-ratio undefined"
            ),
        )
    return math.log(ratio)
```
and extend the `:returns:` line of the docstring to read:
```python
    :returns: The finite log-space anchor, or a :class:`NoDataSentinel` naming
        the specific absence. Never a fabricated zero, never ``inf``/``nan``.
```
- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash

### Task U4.4: `serviceability_anchor` — honest absence

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py` (append a new function after `fictitious_anchor`)
- Test: `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `SurplusValueDistribution` from `babylon.domain.economics.distribution.types` — frozen; fields `fips_code` (exactly 5 chars), `year` (ge=2007, le=2040), `total_surplus_produced` (ge=0), `interest_payments` (ge=0), `ground_rent` (ge=0), `taxes_on_surplus` (ge=0); computed `profit_of_enterprise = s - i - r - t` (may be negative) and `financialization_share` (which **silently returns 0.0 when `total_surplus_produced == 0.0`** — the reason this function must guard the denominator itself rather than delegate).
- Produces: `serviceability_anchor(distribution: SurplusValueDistribution | None) -> float | NoDataSentinel`. U6.6 consumes it via `market_scissors._national_serviceability`, which aggregates the published county distributions as a RATIO OF SUMS (Σi / Σs — never a mean of per-county burdens, which would be the intensive-aggregation class U7.6 catches) and applies this function to the aggregate, so the honest-absence contract (§3.3 clause 1) is the single source of the absent/present decision.

### Task U4.5: `serviceability_anchor` — the present path and the overclaim case

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py` (no change expected — this task proves the U4.4 body)
- Test: `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `serviceability_anchor` from U4.4.
- Produces: nothing new — pins the numeric contract, including that a burden above 1.0 is a legitimate reading (claims exceeding surplus is the debt-spiral condition, not an error).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
Append to `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py`:
```python
@pytest.mark.unit
class TestServiceabilityAnchorPresent:
    """serviceability_anchor computes interest_payments / total_surplus_produced."""

    def test_returns_the_interest_burden(self) -> None:
        """25.0 interest against 100.0 surplus is a burden of 0.25."""

    def test_burden_above_one_is_a_legitimate_reading(self) -> None:
        """Interest exceeding surplus is the debt-spiral condition, not an error."""
        overclaimed = _distribution(surplus=50.0, interest=75.0)
        assert overclaimed.profit_of_enterprise < 0.0
        result = serviceability_anchor(overclaimed)
        assert isinstance(result, float)
        assert result == pytest.approx(1.5)

    def test_matches_financialization_share_when_surplus_is_positive(self) -> None:

        assert serviceability_anchor(distribution) == pytest.approx(
            distribution.financialization_share
        )
```
- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py::TestServiceabilityAnchorPresent`
**Step 2a** replace `serviceability_anchor`'s final statement with `return 0.0`; **Step 2b** run `…::TestServiceabilityAnchorPresent`, expect FAIL — 3 of 4 (`test_returns_the_interest_burden` gets `0.0` not `0.25`; `test_burden_above_one_is_a_legitimate_reading` gets `0.0` not `1.5`; `test_matches_financialization_share_when_surplus_is_positive` gets `0.0` not `0.25`); **Step 3** `git checkout --`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
No production change. Confirm the final statement of `serviceability_anchor` in `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py` reads:
```python
    return distribution.interest_payments / distribution.total_surplus_produced
```
- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py`
Expected: PASS (19 passed)
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash

### Task U4.6: Property tests — absence is the default-tested path

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/property/invariants/test_monetary_anchor_absence.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `fictitious_anchor`, `serviceability_anchor`, `NATIONAL_FIPS`, `UNKNOWN_YEAR` from `babylon.domain.economics.monetary.anchor`.
- Produces: the contract-clause-2 gate. Hypothesis is already a dependency (`pyproject.toml:119`, `hypothesis = "^6.149.0"`); `tests/property/conftest.py` registers the `dev`/`ci`/`nightly` profiles, and `[tool.hypothesis]` in `pyproject.toml` sets `deadline = 500`, `max_examples = 100`. House style: `@pytest.mark.property` plus explicit `@settings(...)` on each test.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
"""Property laws for the monetary anchor's honest-absence contract.

Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-vol3-money-scissors-design.md §3.3.

Contract clause 2 — absence is the NORMAL steady state, not an error path. Real
federal coverage runs 2010-2024; a canonical campaign runs 2010-2109, so the
anchor reads absent for roughly 85% of it. These are laws over the whole input
space rather than examples, because the absent branch is the default branch.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
No production change — the laws hold against U4.1–U4.5. Restore `src/babylon/domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py` to the committed state if Step 2's mutation was applied:

```bash
mise run commit -- "test(monetary): property laws for anchor honest absence

Absence is the normal steady state (~85% of a 2010-2109 campaign), so it is
pinned by laws over the whole input space rather than examples: every outcome
is a finite float or a reasoned sentinel, a zero denominator is never a zero
burden, and repeated calls are bit-identical.

### Task U4.7: Export the anchor and gate its purity

- Test: `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**

### Task U4.8: Verify the unit lands clean

**Files:**
- Test: `tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py`, `tests/property/invariants/test_monetary_anchor_absence.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything built in U4.1–U4.7.
- Produces: a green layering/typecheck/docstring gate, and the U4 acceptance evidence — *anchor absent ⇒ scissors output bit-identical to pre-U4* (trivially true at this point: no engine module reads the anchor until U6, so `qa:regression` must be unchanged).

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the layering gate**
Run: `mise run lint:imports`
Expected: PASS — `domain` may not import `engine`; the new module imports only `math`, `typing`, `credit.types`, `distribution.types`, `tensor`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Run lint, format and typecheck**
Run: `mise run check:quick`
Expected: PASS — Ruff clean, formatting stable, MyPy strict clean on `anchor.py` (both functions carry explicit `float | NoDataSentinel` return types).
- [ ] **Step 3: Run both anchor test files together**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics/monetary/test_anchor.py tests/property/invariants/test_monetary_anchor_absence.py`
Expected: PASS (29 passed)
- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the scissors is untouched**
Run: `mise run qa:regression`
Expected: byte-identical across all 5 scenarios. U4 adds a pure module with no engine consumer; any baseline movement here means something outside this unit changed and must be investigated before proceeding to U5.
- [ ] **Step 5: Record the evidence, then commit.** Append the four gate results verbatim to `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md`'s "Verification evidence" table under a new `U4 gate sweep` row (create the file's skeleton now if U8.3 has not yet run; U8.3 fills the remaining rows), `git add reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md`, then commit. If you prefer not to create the report early, DELETE Step 5 entirely — a commit step with an empty index aborts and leaves the plan in a false "done" state.
```bash
mise run commit -- "chore(monetary): verify U4 monetary anchor lands clean

lint:imports, check:quick and qa:regression all green; the anchor has no
engine consumer until U6, so the five baselines are byte-identical.

### Task U5.1: Extend `GraphInputs` with the four Volume III measure fields

**Files:**

- Test: `tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from earlier units (pure dataclass extension).
- Produces: `GraphInputs.rentier_share`, `GraphInputs.debt_ratio`, `GraphInputs.credit_fragility`, `GraphInputs.financialization_index` — each `float | None = field(default=None)`. U5.2's measures read them; U5.7 (`ContradictionSystem._build_graph_inputs`) fills them.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py::TestVolumeThreeInputFields`

Expected: FAIL — `TypeError: GraphInputs.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'rentier_share'` (and `AttributeError: 'GraphInputs' object has no attribute 'rentier_share'` in the first test).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `src/babylon/domain/dialectics/instances/catalog.py`, extend the `GraphInputs` docstring `Attributes:` block by appending these entries immediately after the existing `market_balance:` entry (which ends at line 121 with `catalog stays defines-free; ``None`` = no market axis this tick.`):

```python
        rentier_share: NATIONAL aggregate ``(i + r + t) / s`` — the share of
            produced surplus value claimed by interest, ground rent and taxes
            rather than retained by the functioning capitalist (Capital Vol.
            III part 5). Computed by the engine as ``Σclaims / Σsurplus``
            across counties — an EXTENSIVE ratio-of-sums, never a mean of
            per-county ratios. ``None`` = no county carries a surplus
            distribution this tick.
        debt_ratio: NATIONAL ``Σ accumulated_debt / Σ annual surplus`` — the
            cumulative enterprise-profit shortfall measured against the
            surplus that would have to service it. ``None`` = no county
            carries a debt accumulation this tick.
        credit_fragility: ``default_rate * spread``, pre-divided by the
            defines-owned crisis reference so 1.0 IS the crisis threshold
            (the engine owns the scale, exactly as it owns the ``tanh``
            scale for ``market_balance``, keeping this module defines-free).
            ``None`` = no national credit state published this tick.
        financialization_index: fictitious claims over real production. Read
            from the scissors' ``fictitious_log`` in ratio space
            (``exp``), which the monetary anchor calibrates to
            ``FictitiousCapitalStock.ratio_to_real`` while real data exists —
            one axis, materially grounded at its origin, endogenous
            thereafter. ``None`` = no market axis this tick.
```

Then append the four fields immediately after the line `market_balance: float | None = field(default=None)`:

```python
    rentier_share: float | None = field(default=None)
    debt_ratio: float | None = field(default=None)
    credit_fragility: float | None = field(default=None)
    financialization_index: float | None = field(default=None)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py::TestVolumeThreeInputFields`

Expected: PASS (3 passed)

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(dialectics): GraphInputs carries the four Vol III money ratios

Four optional float fields — rentier_share, debt_ratio, credit_fragility,
financialization_index — default None so absence is honest (III.11) and the
oppositions bound in the next commit read (0, 0) rather than a fabricated zero.

### Task U5.2: Bind the four Volume III oppositions (catalog 6 → 10)

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/dialectics/instances/catalog.py:262-370` (add the shared ratio helper + four measures after `_price_value_measure`, and four `BoundOpposition` entries inside `build_default_registry`'s `bindings` list)
- Modify: `tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py:28-36` (the stale `test_six_oppositions_bound` assertion)
- Test: `tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `GraphInputs.rentier_share | debt_ratio | credit_fragility | financialization_index` (U5.1).
- Produces: registry keys `"surplus_distribution"`, `"debt_spiral"`, `"credit"`, `"financial"` — the endpoints U5.4's coupling edges and U5.8's ranking rule require.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

First replace the stale six-key assertion at `tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py:28-36` with:

```python
    def test_ten_oppositions_bound(self) -> None:
        assert _reg().keys == (
            "atomization",
            "capital_labor",
            "credit",
            "debt_spiral",
            "financial",
            "imperial",
            "price_value",
            "surplus_distribution",
            "tenancy",
            "wage",
        )
```

Then append this class to the end of the same file:

```python
class TestVolumeThreeOppositions:
    """The four Vol III bindings: shared ratio family, honest absence.

    Every one reads a NON-NEGATIVE ratio against its own material unity
    point (claims == substance) and maps it with the same zero-parameter
    saturating family: ``gap = x/(1+x)``, ``balance = (x-1)/(x+1)``. So the
    balance crosses zero exactly where the claim equals the substance it
    claims, and the gap is 0 only when the claim is absent altogether.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py::TestVolumeThreeOppositions`

Expected: FAIL — `KeyError: 'surplus_distribution'` from `_states(...)[key]` (the registry has no such binding), and `KeyError: 'surplus_distribution'` from `spec_for`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `src/babylon/domain/dialectics/instances/catalog.py`, insert immediately above the line `def build_default_registry(rate_weight: float = 10.0) -> OppositionRegistry[GraphInputs]:`:

```python
def _ratio_reading(ratio: float | None) -> GapReading:
    """Map a non-negative claim/substance ratio onto ``(gap, balance)``.

    The shared measure family for every Volume III money opposition. Each
    reads a ratio of a CLAIM on value to the value that must validate it
    — rentier claims to surplus produced, accumulated debt to annual
    surplus, credit fragility to its crisis reference, fictitious capital
    to real production — so all four share one zero-parameter map::

        gap     = x / (1 + x)
        balance = (x - 1) / (x + 1) = 2 * gap - 1

    Reading the two outputs materially: the balance crosses zero exactly
    at ``x = 1``, the point where the claim equals the substance claimed
    (enterprise profit exactly extinguished, fragility exactly at
    threshold, paper exactly at parity with production). Below it the
    substance leads (pole A); above it the claim leads (pole B). The gap
    is 0 only where the claim is absent altogether — a surplus no rentier
    touches carries no rentier contradiction — and saturates toward 1 as
    the claim runs away from what produces it.

    The family is deliberately scale-free (no coefficient, so this module
    stays defines-free per its import contract); any scaling a ratio needs
    is applied by the engine before it reaches :class:`GraphInputs`, the
    same division of labour ``market_balance`` already uses.

    Args:
        ratio: The claim/substance ratio, or ``None`` when the underlying
            data is absent.

    Returns:
        ``GapReading(0.0, 0.0)`` — the catalog's canonical ABSENT reading —
        when ``ratio`` is ``None`` or negative (a ratio of two non-negative
        magnitudes cannot be negative, so a negative value is corrupt input
        and absence is the honest answer, Constitution III.11). Otherwise
        the saturating reading above.
    """
    if ratio is None or ratio < 0.0:
        return GapReading(gap=0.0, balance=0.0)
    gap = ratio / (1.0 + ratio)
    return GapReading(gap=gap, balance=2.0 * gap - 1.0)


def _surplus_distribution_measure(inputs: GraphInputs) -> GapReading:

### Task U5.3: Correct the stale "five bound contradictions" catalog docstring

**Files:**

Append to `tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py`:

```python
class TestCatalogDocstringAccuracy:
    """The module docstring is a claim about the registry; pin it to the code.

    It went stale twice already — it still said "five bound contradictions"
    and omitted ``price_value`` for the whole period during which
    ``price_value`` was CANONICAL (ADR078). Documentation that describes a
    registry can be checked against that registry, so it is.
    """

    def test_docstring_names_every_registered_key(self) -> None:
        import babylon.domain.dialectics.instances.catalog as catalog_module

        docstring = catalog_module.__doc__ or ""
        for key in build_default_registry().keys:

        docstring = catalog_module.__doc__ or ""
        assert "five bound contradictions" not in docstring
        assert "The five oppositions" not in docstring
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py::TestCatalogDocstringAccuracy`

Expected: FAIL — `AssertionError: docstring never mentions 'credit'` and `assert 'five bound contradictions' not in ...`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Replace the summary line at `catalog.py:1` and the list intro + entries so the docstring covers all ten keys. Line 1 becomes:

```python
"""The production opposition catalog: Babylon's ten bound contradictions.
```

Replace lines 12-14 (`The five oppositions, and the honest measure each is bound to on this / branch (verified against a 30-tick single-county bridged probe, / 2026-07-02):`) with:

```python
The ten oppositions, and the honest measure each is bound to. The first
five were verified against a 30-tick single-county bridged probe
(2026-07-02); ``price_value`` was promoted to CANONICAL by ADR078; the
four Volume III money oppositions were bound by the Vol III money-scissors
work (2026-07-18):
```

Then append these entries to the bullet list, immediately after the `imperial` bullet (which ends at line 38 with `encoded as ``wage feeds imperial`` in the default coupling graph.`):

```
- ``price_value`` — the Market Scissors axis (Program 23, ADR077/ADR078)
  read as an adjunction defect: gap and balance come from the pre-derived
  ``GraphInputs.market_balance``, the engine's ``tanh(price_log / scale)``.
  CANONICAL: it competes for principal contradiction.
- ``surplus_distribution`` — enterprise⇄rentier: the rentier share
  ``(i + r + t) / s``, the division of one county's produced surplus among
  the capitals claiming it. Balance crosses zero where the claims exactly
  extinguish enterprise profit.
- ``debt_spiral`` — solvent⇄indebted: accumulated enterprise-profit
  shortfall over annual surplus. Zero debt reads gap 0 (no contradiction),
  balance −1 (the solvent pole leads).
- ``credit`` — accommodation⇄fragility: ``default_rate * spread``, scaled by
  the engine against its crisis reference so balance crosses zero AT the
  threshold. National; unplaced on the level lattice.
- ``financial`` — real⇄fictitious: claims on future value over present
  production, read from the scissors' ``fictitious_log`` in ratio space.
  National; unplaced on the level lattice.

All four Volume III bindings share ``_ratio_reading``'s zero-parameter
saturating map and all four are ``antagonistic=False``: the division of
surplus among capitals is real conflict but INTRA-class, and only
``capital_labor`` and ``imperial`` carry the rupture-producing flag.

### Task U5.4: Land the five derived coupling edges

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/dialectics/instances/catalog.py:373-394` (the `_DEFAULT_COUPLINGS` comment block and tuple)
- Modify: `tests/unit/dialectics/test_coupling.py:136-166` (`test_registered_couplings_are_kept`, `test_only_the_bound_edges_survive`, `test_unbound_transforms_are_skipped_and_logged`)
- Test: `tests/unit/dialectics/test_coupling.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: registry keys `surplus_distribution`, `debt_spiral`, `credit`, `financial` (U5.2).
- Produces: a `build_default_coupling_graph(...)` result containing exactly ten non-`contains` edges, including the two `transforms` edges U5.8's ranking rule walks.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Replace `tests/unit/dialectics/test_coupling.py:136-166` (the three methods of `TestDefaultCouplingGraph`) with:

```python
    def test_registered_couplings_are_kept(self) -> None:
        graph = build_default_coupling_graph(build_default_registry())
        triples = {_triple(c) for c in graph.couplings}

        """Mutual feeds at two moments of one cycle: in expansion price
        momentum drives speculation (fictitious_drive reads price_velocity);
        in correction the bubble snaps prices. Nothing in CouplingGraph
        requires acyclicity, and the reciprocal pair is the truthful record."""
        graph = build_default_coupling_graph(build_default_registry())
        triples = {_triple(c) for c in graph.couplings}
        assert ("price_value", "financial", "feeds") in triples

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/dialectics/test_coupling.py::TestDefaultCouplingGraph`

Expected: FAIL — `test_price_value_and_financial_feed_each_other` fails with `assert ('price_value', 'financial', 'feeds') in triples` (that edge is not declared), and `test_only_the_bound_edges_survive` fails on the set comparison.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Replace the comment block beginning `# The ratified crisis-producer map.` through the closing `)` of the `_DEFAULT_COUPLINGS` tuple with:

```python
# The ratified crisis-producer map. Every edge is DERIVED — read off the code
# against ``coupling.py``'s operational definitions of the five kinds, not

    Coupling(source="wage", target="capital_labor", kind="feeds"),

    # per-class wage relation feeds the frame-level imperial-rent reading.
    Coupling(source="wage", target="imperial", kind="feeds"),
    # the realized wage⇄value flow IS the scissors' drive term (ADR078): the
    # market axis integrates what the wage relation produces each tick.
    Coupling(source="wage", target="price_value", kind="feeds"),
    #
    # The reciprocal pair below is not a modelling flourish: the two edges
    # fire at DIFFERENT moments of one cycle, and both are readable in
    # engine/systems/market_scissors.py.
    #
    # Expansion — fictitious_drive includes ``momentum_coupling *

    Coupling(source="financial", target="price_value", kind="feeds"),
    # The interest burden i/s sets serviceable_divergence — the ceiling on
    # fictitious_log before the snap — so the distribution LIMITS the
    # financial axis's reachable state space: ``constrains``, not ``feeds``.
    Coupling(source="surplus_distribution", target="financial", kind="constrains"),

```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(dialectics): land the five derived Vol III coupling edges

Both reserved transforms edges survive build_default_coupling_graph now that
their endpoints are bound; plus a reciprocal price_value<->financial feeds pair

### Task U5.5: Add `coupling_graph` to the service container and protocol

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/kernel/services.py:46` (add `coupling_graph` to `ServicesProtocol`, beside `opposition_registry`)
- Modify: `src/babylon/engine/services.py:154-158` (field declaration), `:259` (create kwarg), `:328-333` (default construction), `:355` (pass-through in the returned container)
- Test: `tests/unit/engine/test_services_coupling_graph.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `build_default_coupling_graph(registry) -> CouplingGraph` (U5.4).
- Produces: `services.coupling_graph: CouplingGraph | None` — the attribute U5.8's `ContradictionSystem` reads.

callers: the coupling layer was dormant scaffolding. Per Constitution III.10
a construct must not ship as vocabulary, so it is wired here and consumed by
``ContradictionSystem``. These tests pin the wiring; the consumption contract

In `src/babylon/kernel/services.py`, add after line 46 (`opposition_registry: Any`):

In `src/babylon/engine/services.py`, add after line 158 (the `opposition_registry: Any = field(default=None)` declaration):

    # Typed coupling graph over the opposition registry (Vol III money
    # scissors, U5). Built by ``create`` beside the registry: ContradictionSystem

### Task U5.6: Add the `credit_fragility_scale` define

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/config/defines/capital_vol3.py` (append the field to `CapitalVolumeIIIDefines`, after `housing_capitalization_rate_default` — U2.3 created this category as the Vol III coefficient home, and `default_rate_estimate` (the other factor of `default_rate * spread`) already lives there)
- Modify: `src/babylon/data/defines.yaml:195-202` (regenerated, not hand-edited)
- Test: `tests/unit/config/test_tension_credit_fragility_scale.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: `defines.capital_vol3.credit_fragility_scale: float` — the divisor U5.7 applies before `credit_fragility` reaches `GraphInputs`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/unit/config/test_tension_credit_fragility_scale.py`:

```python
"""The credit-fragility reference scale is a player-editable define.

``GraphInputs.credit_fragility`` reaches the defines-free catalog already
divided by this reference, so the shared ratio map's balance crosses zero
exactly AT the crisis threshold. Hardcoding the divisor in the engine would

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_money_inputs.py`

Expected: FAIL — `assert 0.4 == None` style failures (`inputs.rentier_share is None` in `TestCountyRatios`), because `_build_graph_inputs` never sets the four fields. `TestNationalRatios::test_credit_fragility_arrives_in_threshold_units` fails with `ImportError: cannot import name 'NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR'` if U3 has not landed — U3 is a prerequisite of this task.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `src/babylon/engine/systems/contradiction.py`, add to the imports (after line 46, `from babylon.formulas.contradiction import calculate_wealth_asymmetry_gap`):

```python
import math

from babylon.domain.economics.distribution.types import (
    DebtAccumulation,
    SurplusValueDistribution,
)
from babylon.domain.economics.tick.graph_bridge import (
    NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR,
    TICK_DYNAMICS_KEY,
)
```

(Keep `import math` at the top of the stdlib import block, above the `from babylon...` imports, per the file's existing ordering; Ruff's isort will place it.)

Replace the `return GraphInputs(...)` block at lines 292-301 with:

```python
        rentier_share, debt_ratio = self._county_money_ratios(graph)

        financialization_index: float | None = None
        if isinstance(market_raw, dict) and "fictitious_log" in market_raw:
            # The fictitious axis IS a log-ratio around the value anchor, so
            # exp() returns it as the fictitious/real ratio directly — one
            # axis, calibrated to FictitiousCapitalStock.ratio_to_real by the
            # monetary anchor while real data exists, endogenous after 2024.
            # The axis's own bound is the overflow clamp: a log outside it is
            # corrupt input, and raising OverflowError mid-tick helps nobody.
            bound = float(services.defines.market.max_abs_log)
            clamped = max(-bound, min(bound, float(market_raw["fictitious_log"])))
            financialization_index = math.exp(clamped)

        return GraphInputs(
            exploitation_pairs=tuple(exploitation),
            wage_value_pairs=tuple(wage_value),
            tenancy_pairs=tuple(tenancy),
            solidarity_subgraph=extract_solidarity_subgraph(graph),
            exploitation_id_pairs=tuple(exploitation_ids),
            wage_value_id_pairs=tuple(wage_value_ids),
            tenancy_id_pairs=tuple(tenancy_ids),
            market_balance=market_balance,
            rentier_share=rentier_share,
            debt_ratio=debt_ratio,
            credit_fragility=self._credit_fragility(
                graph, float(services.defines.capital_vol3.credit_fragility_scale)
            ),
            financialization_index=financialization_index,
        )
```

Add these two helpers immediately after `_build_graph_inputs`, before the existing `_edge_wealths` staticmethod at line 303:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def _county_money_ratios(graph: GraphProtocol) -> tuple[float | None, float | None]:

### Task U5.8: Make the coupling graph constrain principal-contradiction ranking

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/engine/systems/contradiction.py:1-34` (module docstring — add the coupling-direction bullet), `:193-200` (inside `_step_registry`, after the shadow split), and add one private method
- Test: `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_coupling_rank.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `services.coupling_graph` (U5.5), `CouplingGraph.upstream_for(key) -> tuple[Coupling, ...]`, `defines.tension.principal_rate_weight`.
- Produces: the corrected `is_principal` flag seen by `contradiction_frames`, RUPTURE, the regime classifier, and the `opposition_states` stash.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_coupling_rank.py`:

```python
"""The CouplingGraph's earn-its-keep duty (owner-approved, Vol III U5).

Constitution III.10 forbids shipping a construct as vocabulary, so the
coupling graph gets a job: it constrains principal-contradiction ranking.
A ``transforms`` edge means "the source's output becomes the target's
input" — so a target cannot lead the whole formation while the source that
supplies it reads ABSENT. Crisis has a direction of travel, and the
coupling graph is what knows it.

This is the ONE place the Vol III design alters existing semantics rather
than filling absence, so the contract is pinned in BOTH directions: the
target is demoted when its source is absent, and it ranks completely
normally when the source is present.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_coupling_rank.py::TestTransformsSourceAbsent`

Expected: FAIL — `assert 'target' == 'rival'` (the system ranks purely by score and never consults the coupling graph).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `src/babylon/engine/systems/contradiction.py`, add this method immediately after `_apply_interventions` (which ends at line 222):

```python
    def _respect_coupling_direction(
        self,
        states: tuple[OppositionState, ...],
        services: ServicesProtocol,
    ) -> tuple[OppositionState, ...]:
        """Forbid a ``transforms`` TARGET from leading while its SOURCE is absent.

        The coupling graph's first production duty (Constitution III.10: no
        construct ships as vocabulary). ``coupling.py`` defines ``transforms``
        as "the source's output becomes the target's input prices" — so a
        target whose input has no reading cannot honestly be the contradiction
        whose development leads all others. Crisis has a direction of travel;
        this is what knows it.

        Absence is read off the measure, not guessed: ``gap == 0.0 AND
        balance == 0.0`` is the catalog's canonical no-data reading (empty
        pair sets, ``None`` market balance, ``None`` money ratio). A real
        reading of *nothing claimed* — gap 0 with the substance pole leading
        at balance −1 — is PRESENT, and does not demote anything.

        Only the principal is re-ranked; no gap, balance, rate or leading
        pole is touched. When every eligible candidate is blocked the
        original principal stands: a tick must never end without one.

        Args:
            states: This tick's canonical (non-shadow) states, already
                intervened.

            The same states, with at most one ``is_principal`` flag moved.
        """
        coupling_graph = services.coupling_graph
        if coupling_graph is None:
            return states
        principal = next((state for state in states if state.is_principal), None)
        if principal is None:
            return states

        absent = {
            state.key for state in states if state.gap == 0.0 and state.balance == 0.0

Then wire it into `_step_registry`. Replace lines 197-200:

```python
        if canonical:
            self._write_frames(graph, services, registry, canonical)
            self._maybe_rupture(services, canonical, tick)
            self._classify_regime(graph, services, registry, canonical, tick)
```

with:

```python
        if canonical:
            # The coupling graph corrects the ranking BEFORE anything reads it,
            # so frames, rupture, the regime classifier and the stash all agree
            # on one principal contradiction.
            canonical = self._respect_coupling_direction(canonical, services)
            self._write_frames(graph, services, registry, canonical)
            self._maybe_rupture(services, canonical, tick)
            self._classify_regime(graph, services, registry, canonical, tick)
```

Finally, add this bullet to the module docstring's numbered list, after item 3 (which ends at line 17 with `principal/secondary = registry principal + runner-up);`):

```
3b. corrects the ranking against the injected ``CouplingGraph``: a
    ``transforms`` target cannot rank principal while the source supplying
    its input reads absent (Vol III money scissors, U5). This runs BEFORE
    frames/rupture/regime so every consumer sees one principal;
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_coupling_rank.py tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_system.py`

Expected: PASS (both files — the existing system tests confirm no regression in unranked-by-coupling worlds)

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(engine): coupling graph constrains principal-contradiction ranking

The CouplingGraph's first production duty (III.10: no construct ships as
vocabulary). A transforms target cannot rank principal while the source whose
output IS its input reads absent — absence being the catalog's canonical
(gap 0, balance 0) pair, never a real zero-claim reading. Pinned in both
directions; inert without an injected graph; the original principal stands
when every candidate is blocked.

This is the one place the Vol III design alters existing semantics, so U8's
delta analysis reports principal-contradiction changes per scenario.

### Task U5.9: Close the unit — full gate and acceptance evidence

**Files:**
- Test: `tests/unit/dialectics/`, `tests/unit/engine/`, `tests/unit/config/`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything U5.1–U5.8 produced.
- Produces: the acceptance evidence U8's baseline-delta report cites.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the dialectics and engine suites together**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/dialectics tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_system.py tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_money_inputs.py tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_coupling_rank.py tests/unit/engine/test_services_coupling_graph.py tests/unit/kernel/test_services_protocol.py`

Expected: PASS. If another test asserts a specific principal-contradiction key, it is a genuine U5 consequence (catalog 6 → 10 changes ranking, spec §7 risk 4) — record which test and which key, do NOT weaken the assertion, and carry the observation into U8's delta report.

Then confirm §5 hazard 3 — no new shadow accumulator was introduced. Run:

```bash
rg -n 'persistent_data\[|context\.persistent' src/babylon/engine/systems/contradiction.py src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py
```

Expected: no NEW key beyond those present on `dev`. Every cross-tick quantity this program adds lives on a specified model field (DebtAccumulation, MarketState), never a shadow attribute (VIII.11).

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the registry reports ten keys**

Run: `poetry run python -c "from babylon.domain.dialectics.instances.catalog import build_default_registry as r; print(len(r().keys), r().keys)"`

Expected: `10 ('atomization', 'capital_labor', 'credit', 'debt_spiral', 'financial', 'imperial', 'price_value', 'surplus_distribution', 'tenancy', 'wage')`

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm both reserved `transforms` edges survive the builder**

Run: `poetry run python -c "import logging; logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO); from babylon.domain.dialectics.instances.catalog import build_default_registry as r, build_default_coupling_graph as g; print(sorted((c.source, c.target, c.kind) for c in g(r()).couplings if c.kind == 'transforms'))"`

Expected: `[('credit', 'financial', 'transforms'), ('surplus_distribution', 'debt_spiral', 'transforms')]`, and exactly two `Skipping coupling` INFO lines on stderr, both naming Volume II endpoints (`realization`, `disproportionality`).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the full fast gate**

Run: `mise run check:quick`

Expected: PASS — lint + format + typecheck green (the `test:unit` leg is deliberately excluded: the full suite is forbidden in this plan; Step 1's scoped run already covers every file U5 touched). Do NOT run `qa:regression` here: baselines are expected to move and U8 owns that ceremony after the owner reads the delta analysis.

- [ ] **Step 5: Record the evidence, then commit.**

Paste Steps 2–3's verbatim stdout into `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md` under a new "U5 acceptance evidence" subsection (registry key tuple; the two surviving `transforms` triples; the two `Skipping coupling` INFO lines), `git add reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md`, then commit.

```bash
mise run commit -- "test(dialectics): U5 acceptance evidence — registry 10, both reserved edges live

Registry reports ten keys; surplus_distribution->debt_spiral and
credit->financial survive build_default_coupling_graph with only the two
Volume II circulation edges still skipped; the transforms-target ranking rule
holds in both directions. qa:regression is deliberately NOT re-baselined here —
U8 owns the delta analysis and the ceremony commit.

### Task U5.10: Scale `debt_ratio` by `DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD` so 1.0 IS the spiral threshold

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/engine/systems/contradiction.py` (`_county_money_ratios` return, `_build_graph_inputs`)
- Modify: `src/babylon/domain/dialectics/instances/catalog.py` (the `debt_spiral` docstring bullet)
- Test: `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_money_inputs.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `GameDefines.capital_vol3.debt_spiral_threshold` (U2.3) — the
  `DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD` value, now moddable.
- Produces: `GraphInputs.debt_ratio` in THRESHOLD UNITS, matching the division of
  labour `credit_fragility` (U5.6) and `market_balance` already use: the engine
  owns the scale, the catalog stays defines-free.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
class TestDebtRatioIsInThresholdUnits:
    """§3.6 row 10: DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD was a dead constant designed as a
    crisis signal and never wired. The debt_spiral opposition's shared ratio
    map crosses balance 0 at x == 1, so 1.0 must MEAN 'at the debt-spiral
    threshold' — otherwise the opposition's unity point is arbitrary."""

        assert services.defines.capital_vol3.debt_spiral_threshold == pytest.approx(0.5)
        assert _inputs(graph, services).debt_ratio == pytest.approx(1.0)

    def test_a_modded_threshold_moves_the_unity_point(self) -> None:
        from babylon.config.defines import CapitalVolumeIIIDefines, GameDefines

        services = ServiceContainer.create(

                capital_vol3=CapitalVolumeIIIDefines(debt_spiral_threshold=0.25)
            )
        )
        assert _inputs(graph, services).debt_ratio == pytest.approx(2.0)
```
- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_money_inputs.py::TestDebtRatioIsInThresholdUnits`
Expected: FAIL with `assert 0.5 == 1.0` (the raw ratio is passed through unscaled).
- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Change `_county_money_ratios`'s signature to accept the scale and apply it:
```python
    @staticmethod
    def _county_money_ratios(
        graph: GraphProtocol, debt_spiral_threshold: float
    ) -> tuple[float | None, float | None]:
```
and its final two lines from:
```python
        debt_ratio = total_debt / total_surplus if saw_debt else None
        return (total_claims / total_surplus, debt_ratio)
```
to:
```python
        # DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD (§3.6 row 10) was a dead constant designed as a
        # crisis signal. Dividing here — not in the defines-free catalog — makes
        # 1.0 mean "exactly at the debt spiral", so _ratio_reading's balance
        # crosses zero AT the threshold rather than at an arbitrary debt/surplus
        # parity nobody argued for.
        debt_ratio = (
            (total_debt / total_surplus) / debt_spiral_threshold if saw_debt else None
        )
        return (total_claims / total_surplus, debt_ratio)
```
and the call site in `_build_graph_inputs`:
```python
        rentier_share, debt_ratio = self._county_money_ratios(
            graph, float(services.defines.capital_vol3.debt_spiral_threshold)
        )
```
Finally correct the catalog docstring bullet (U5.3) from
`` `debt_spiral` — solvent⇄indebted: accumulated enterprise-profit shortfall over annual surplus. ``
to
`` `debt_spiral` — solvent⇄indebted: accumulated enterprise-profit shortfall over annual surplus, scaled by the engine against `capital_vol3.debt_spiral_threshold` so balance crosses zero AT the spiral threshold. ``
- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_contradiction_money_inputs.py tests/unit/dialectics/test_catalog.py`
Expected: PASS. Note that U5.2's `test_zero_claim_is_no_contradiction_not_maximal`
(`debt_ratio=0.0` → gap 0, balance −1) is unaffected: 0/0.5 is still 0.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(engine): scale debt_ratio by DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD (kills the dead constant)

§3.6 row 10: the threshold was designed as a fifth FinancialCrisisAssessment
signal and had zero references. debt_ratio now reaches the defines-free
catalog in threshold units, so the debt_spiral balance crosses zero AT the
spiral rather than at an unargued debt/surplus parity.

### Task U6.1: Fix the intensive-aggregation defect in `_mean_profit_rate`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py:411-429`
- Test: `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `GraphProtocol.query_nodes(node_type=...)`, `node.attributes["tick_capital_stock"]` (already stamped by `graph_bridge.py:104`), `node.attributes["tick_profit_rate"]`.
- Produces: `_capital_weighted_mean(graph, node_type, attr, *, weight_attr="tick_capital_stock") -> float | None` — a new module-level helper in `market_scissors.py` that U6.6/U6.7 do **not** reuse directly (they use a different helper, `_mean_ratio_to_capital`, added in U6.6) but which fixes `_mean_profit_rate`'s call site inside `_maybe_correct` (unchanged call site, only the body of `_mean_profit_rate` changes).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Add to `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py`, inside `class TestCorrection:` (after `test_healthy_profit_rate_services_the_bubble`):

```python

        would service the 1.5 overhang (0.55 + 4*0.5 = 2.55 > 1.5, no
        snap); the capital-weighted mean drags the aggregate to ~0.001 and
        the snap fires (fixes the intensive-aggregation defect, §3.6 last

        graph = _euphoric_graph(fictitious_log=1.5)
        graph.update_node("metropole", tick_profit_rate=1.0, tick_capital_stock=1.0)

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Replace lines 411-429 of `src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py` (the current `_mean_profit_rate` function) with:

### Task U6.2: `calculate_serviceable_divergence` gains an interest-burden term

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/formulas/market.py:108-128`
- Test: `tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new (pure function, no cross-unit dependency).
- Produces: `calculate_serviceable_divergence(profit_rate, *, base, slope, interest_burden=None, interest_slope=0.0) -> float` — the two new keyword args are consumed by Task U6.6 (`MarketScissorsSystem._maybe_correct`), which passes `defines.correction_interest_slope` (added in U6.5) as `interest_slope`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Add to `tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py`, after `class TestServiceableDivergence:` (before `class TestOverhang:`):

```python
class TestServiceableDivergenceInterestBurden:
    """U6: a financialised county tightens its own correction threshold
    independent of profit rate (Vol. III part 3 meeting part 5)."""

    def test_interest_burden_tightens_the_threshold(self) -> None:
        healthy = calculate_serviceable_divergence(0.1, base=0.55, slope=4.0)
        tightened = calculate_serviceable_divergence(
            0.1, base=0.55, slope=4.0, interest_burden=0.3, interest_slope=1.0
        )
        assert tightened < healthy
        assert tightened == pytest.approx(0.65)

    def test_absent_interest_burden_is_bit_identical_to_pre_u6(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_serviceable_divergence(
            0.1, base=0.55, slope=4.0, interest_burden=None, interest_slope=1.0
        ) == pytest.approx(0.95)

    def test_zero_interest_slope_is_inert(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_serviceable_divergence(
            0.1, base=0.55, slope=4.0, interest_burden=5.0, interest_slope=0.0
        ) == pytest.approx(0.95)

    def test_floor_at_zero(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_serviceable_divergence(
            0.0, base=0.1, slope=0.0, interest_burden=1.0, interest_slope=1.0
        ) == 0.0
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py::TestServiceableDivergenceInterestBurden`
Expected: FAIL — `TypeError: calculate_serviceable_divergence() got an unexpected keyword argument 'interest_burden'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Replace lines 108-128 of `src/babylon/formulas/market.py` (the current `calculate_serviceable_divergence`) with:

```python
def calculate_serviceable_divergence(
    profit_rate: float | None,
    *,
    base: float,
    slope: float,
    interest_burden: float | None = None,
    interest_slope: float = 0.0,
) -> float:
    """Log fictitious/real divergence the rate of profit can service (ADR078).

    ``base + slope * max(profit_rate, 0) - interest_slope * max(interest_burden, 0)``,
    floored at 0: a healthy rate of profit carries a larger claims
    structure; its FALL is what turns an existing bubble into an unpayable
    one — Vol. III part 3 (the falling rate) meeting part 5 (fictitious
    capital). A financialised county's own interest burden (interest
    payments relative to capital, U6) tightens the same threshold
    independent of the profit rate — a second, orthogonal claim on the
    credit system's tolerance. A loss-making, debt-free economy still
    services the base (the credit system's intrinsic tolerance is a floor,
    not a debt).

    :param profit_rate: Realized rate of profit, or ``None`` when no profit
        observable exists this tick — the base alone is used (honest
        absence, Constitution III.11; no rate is fabricated).
    :param base: Serviceable log-divergence at zero profit and zero
        interest burden (>= 0).
    :param slope: Additional serviceable log-divergence per unit profit rate.
    :param interest_burden: Interest-payments-to-capital ratio, or ``None``
        when no territory carries the accounting pair — the term drops out
        entirely (honest absence, III.11), matching pre-U6 behavior exactly.
    :param interest_slope: Serviceable log-divergence LOST per unit
        interest burden (a ``MarketDefines.correction_interest_slope``
        coefficient).
    :returns: The serviceable log-divergence, floored at 0.
    """
    profit_term = 0.0 if profit_rate is None else slope * max(profit_rate, 0.0)
    interest_term = (
        0.0 if interest_burden is None else interest_slope * max(interest_burden, 0.0)
    )
    return max(base + profit_term - interest_term, 0.0)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py`
Expected: PASS — the new class plus all pre-existing `TestServiceableDivergence` cases (unaffected: `interest_burden` defaults to `None`, contributing `interest_term = 0.0`, reproducing the exact pre-U6 values).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(market): add an interest-burden term to serviceable divergence

calculate_serviceable_divergence gains optional interest_burden/
interest_slope kwargs, defaulting to a no-op — a financialised county

### Task U6.3: New `calculate_correction_severity` — the accumulated-debt term

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/formulas/market.py` (append new function at end of file, after `calculate_correction_snap`, currently ending at line 157 pre-U6.2; after Task U6.2's edit the file is longer — locate by the last function in the file, `calculate_correction_snap`, and append immediately after it; also update the `__all__` list at lines 20-28)
- Test: `tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new (pure function).
- Produces: `calculate_correction_severity(base_severity, *, debt_ratio, slope) -> float` — consumed by Task U6.7 (`MarketScissorsSystem._maybe_correct`), which passes `defines.correction_severity` as `base_severity` and `defines.correction_debt_slope` (added U6.5) as `slope`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Add to the top-level import in `tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py`:

```python
from babylon.formulas.market import (
    calculate_correction_severity,
    calculate_correction_snap,
    calculate_ema,
    calculate_growth_drive,
    calculate_overhang,
    calculate_scissors_balance,
    calculate_scissors_step,
    calculate_serviceable_divergence,
)
```

Append a new class at the end of the file:

```python
class TestCorrectionSeverity:
    """U6: a debt spiral makes the re-identification of claims with real
    surplus MORE violent — the accumulated-debt term on correction
    severity."""

    def test_absent_debt_ratio_is_the_base_severity(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_correction_severity(0.6, debt_ratio=None, slope=0.5) == 0.6

    def test_debt_ratio_increases_severity(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_correction_severity(0.6, debt_ratio=0.2, slope=0.5) == pytest.approx(0.7)

    def test_severity_clamps_to_one(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_correction_severity(0.6, debt_ratio=5.0, slope=1.0) == 1.0

    def test_negative_debt_ratio_never_reduces_severity(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_correction_severity(0.6, debt_ratio=-1.0, slope=0.5) == 0.6

    def test_zero_slope_is_inert(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_correction_severity(0.6, debt_ratio=10.0, slope=0.0) == 0.6
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py::TestCorrectionSeverity`
Expected: FAIL — `ImportError: cannot import name 'calculate_correction_severity' from 'babylon.formulas.market'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `src/babylon/formulas/market.py`, update the `__all__` list (currently lines 20-28) to:

```python
__all__ = [
    "calculate_correction_severity",
    "calculate_correction_snap",
    "calculate_ema",
    "calculate_growth_drive",
    "calculate_overhang",
    "calculate_scissors_balance",
    "calculate_scissors_step",
    "calculate_serviceable_divergence",
]
```

Append at the very end of the file, after `calculate_correction_snap` (two blank lines separating, matching the file's existing top-level spacing):

```python
def calculate_correction_severity(
    base_severity: float, *, debt_ratio: float | None, slope: float
) -> float:
    """Fraction of the fictitious log-ratio closed by one snap, debt-adjusted.

    A debt spiral (U6: accumulated deficit relative to capital) makes the
    violent re-identification of claims with real surplus MORE violent,
    not less — the credit system has less slack to absorb a slow unwind.

    :param base_severity: The ADR078 baseline (``MarketDefines.correction_severity``).
    :param debt_ratio: Accumulated-debt-to-capital ratio, or ``None`` when
        no territory carries the accounting pair — the base is used
        unchanged (honest absence, III.11; bit-identical to pre-U6
        behavior).
    :param slope: Additional severity per unit debt ratio (a
        ``MarketDefines.correction_debt_slope`` coefficient).
    :returns: ``base_severity`` plus the debt term, clamped to ``[0, 1]``
        (:class:`~babylon.models.market.MarketState` cannot express a
        severity outside the unit interval).
    """
    if debt_ratio is None:
        return base_severity
    return min(max(base_severity + slope * max(debt_ratio, 0.0), 0.0), 1.0)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py`
Expected: PASS for every case in the file — `TestCorrectionSeverity` (new) plus every pre-existing class.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(market): add calculate_correction_severity (accumulated-debt term)

A debt spiral makes the correction snap's re-identification of claims

### Task U6.4: New `calculate_anchor_pull` — the monetary-anchor drive term

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/formulas/market.py` (append new function at end of file, after `calculate_correction_severity` added in U6.3)
- Test: `tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new (pure function; `anchor` is a plain `float | None`, already resolved by the caller from `anchor.fictitious_anchor`'s `float | NoDataSentinel` return before this function ever sees it).
- Produces: `calculate_anchor_pull(anchor, current, *, gain) -> float` — consumed by Task U6.8 (`MarketScissorsSystem._advance`), which passes `prior.fictitious_log` as `current` and `defines.anchor_pull` (added U6.5) as `gain`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Update the import in `tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py`:

```python
from babylon.formulas.market import (
    calculate_anchor_pull,
    calculate_correction_severity,
    calculate_correction_snap,
    calculate_ema,
    calculate_growth_drive,
    calculate_overhang,
    calculate_scissors_balance,
    calculate_scissors_step,
    calculate_serviceable_divergence,
)
```

Append a new class at the end of the file:

```python
class TestAnchorPull:
    """D1/U6: pulls the fictitious oscillator toward the FRED-grounded
    anchor while real financial data covers this tick; absent anchor is
    inert — the oscillator's endogenous dynamics carry the other ~85% of

    def test_absent_anchor_is_zero_drive(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_anchor_pull(None, 0.4, gain=0.3) == 0.0

    def test_pulls_toward_a_higher_anchor(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_anchor_pull(1.0, 0.4, gain=0.3) == pytest.approx(0.18)

    def test_pulls_toward_a_lower_anchor(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_anchor_pull(0.0, 0.4, gain=0.3) == pytest.approx(-0.12)

    def test_zero_gain_is_inert_even_when_anchored(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_anchor_pull(1.0, 0.4, gain=0.0) == 0.0

    def test_at_the_anchor_the_pull_is_zero(self) -> None:
        assert calculate_anchor_pull(0.4, 0.4, gain=0.5) == 0.0
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py::TestAnchorPull`
Expected: FAIL — `ImportError: cannot import name 'calculate_anchor_pull' from 'babylon.formulas.market'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Also add `"calculate_anchor_pull"` to `__all__`, alphabetically first (before `"calculate_correction_severity"`):

```python
# src/babylon/formulas/market.py — add "calculate_anchor_pull" to __all__,
# alphabetically first (before "calculate_correction_severity"):
```

Append at the very end of `src/babylon/formulas/market.py`, after `calculate_correction_severity` (two blank lines separating):

```python
def calculate_anchor_pull(anchor: float | None, current: float, *, gain: float) -> float:
    """Drive term pulling the fictitious log-ratio toward its real-data anchor.

    D1 (owner ruling, 2026-07-18): real FRED data seeds and anchors the
    oscillator where it exists (2010-2024); past the data horizon the
    oscillator's own dynamics ARE the money system. This term is the
    "anchors" half: while a real ratio exists, it exerts a proportional
    pull alongside the drive and reversion terms already in
    :func:`calculate_scissors_step`.

    :param anchor: The log-space target

        the term is then exactly 0.0, leaving the endogenous dynamics
        untouched (honest absence, Constitution III.11).
    :param current: The oscillator's current ``fictitious_log``.
    :param gain: ``MarketDefines.anchor_pull`` — the pull's strength.
    :returns: ``gain * (anchor - current)``, or ``0.0`` when ``anchor`` is
        ``None``.
    """
    if anchor is None:
        return 0.0
    return gain * (anchor - current)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/formulas/test_market.py`
Expected: PASS for the entire file.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(market): add calculate_anchor_pull (D1 monetary-anchor drive term)

### Task U6.5: New `MarketDefines` coefficients + regenerate `defines.yaml`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/config/defines/market.py:203-213` (append after `wealth_axis_kick_gain`, the last field)
- Modify: `src/babylon/data/defines.yaml:997` (regenerated, not hand-edited — see Step 3)
- Test: `tests/unit/config/test_market_defines.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new.
- Produces: `MarketDefines.anchor_pull: float`, `MarketDefines.correction_interest_slope: float`, `MarketDefines.correction_debt_slope: float` — consumed by Tasks U6.6 (`correction_interest_slope`), U6.7 (`correction_debt_slope`), and U6.8 (`anchor_pull`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/unit/config/test_market_defines.py` (after `class TestCorrectionLedger:`):

```python
class TestU6Coefficients:
    """U6: the scissors-loop-closing coefficients (interest burden, debt
    spiral, and the D1 monetary anchor pull)."""

    def test_defaults(self) -> None:
        d = MarketDefines()
        assert d.correction_interest_slope == 2.0
        assert d.correction_debt_slope == 0.5
        assert d.anchor_pull == 0.1

    def test_anchor_pull_bounded_to_unit_interval(self) -> None:
        with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
            MarketDefines(anchor_pull=1.5)

    def test_correction_interest_slope_rejects_negative(self) -> None:
        with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
            MarketDefines(correction_interest_slope=-1.0)

    def test_correction_debt_slope_rejects_negative(self) -> None:
        with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
            MarketDefines(correction_debt_slope=-1.0)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/config/test_market_defines.py::TestU6Coefficients`
Expected: FAIL — `AttributeError: 'MarketDefines' object has no attribute 'correction_interest_slope'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Append inside the `MarketDefines` class in `src/babylon/config/defines/market.py`, immediately after the `wealth_axis_kick_gain` field (currently the last field, ending at line 213 before the closing of the class):

```python
    anchor_pull: float = Field(
        default=0.1,
        ge=0.0,
        le=1.0,
        description=(
            "Game design: strength of the pull toward fictitious_anchor "
            "(D1) while real FRED-backed financial data anchors this "
            "tick; the pull is exactly 0 when the anchor is absent, "
            "leaving the endogenous dynamics untouched."
        ),
    )
    correction_interest_slope: float = Field(
        default=2.0,
        ge=0.0,
        le=20.0,
        description=(
            "Game design: serviceable log-divergence LOST per unit "
            "interest-burden-to-capital ratio — a financialised county "
            "tightens its own correction threshold independent of profit "
            "rate (Capital Vol. III part 3 meeting part 5)."
        ),
    )
    correction_debt_slope: float = Field(
        default=0.5,
        ge=0.0,
        le=5.0,
        description=(
            "Game design: additional correction severity per unit "
            "accumulated-debt-to-capital ratio — a debt spiral makes the "
            "re-identification of claims with real surplus MORE violent."
        ),
    )
```

Then regenerate the canonical config file:

```bash
poetry run python tools/generate_defines_config.py
```

This appends the three new `market:` lines to `src/babylon/data/defines.yaml` (after `wealth_axis_kick_gain`, currently the last line of that block at line 997) with their descriptions and bounds as inline comments — do not hand-edit the YAML.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/config/test_market_defines.py`
Expected: PASS for the entire file. Also run `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/config/test_constants_sync.py::TestDefinesYamlSync` to confirm `defines.yaml` stayed in sync with the schema (`test_defines_yaml_in_sync_with_schema`, `test_shipped_defines_yaml_roundtrips_to_defaults`) — expected PASS since the file was regenerated, not hand-edited.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(config): add U6 scissors-loop-closing coefficients to MarketDefines

anchor_pull, correction_interest_slope, correction_debt_slope —
player-editable via defines.yaml, regenerated from the schema.

### Task U6.6: Wire the interest-burden term into the correction threshold

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py` — add the four-line import block (`SurplusValueDistribution`, `serviceability_anchor` (C-5), `NoDataSentinel`, `TICK_DYNAMICS_KEY`), add two module-level helpers, rewrite `_maybe_correct`
- Test: `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py` — add four imports (`SurplusValueDistribution`, `ClassDistribution`, `TICK_DYNAMICS_KEY`, `CountyEconomicState`), the module-level `_county_with` helper, and one test

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `calculate_serviceable_divergence(..., interest_burden=..., interest_slope=...)` (U6.2), `defines.correction_interest_slope` (U6.5), per-territory `tick_interest_burden` (already stamped — raw interest-payments dollar figure, `graph_bridge.py`'s Feature-024 block) and `tick_capital_stock` (already stamped, `graph_bridge.py:104`); `SurplusValueDistribution` (`babylon.domain.economics.distribution.types:38`; required fields `fips_code` (exactly 5 chars), `year` (ge=2007, le=2040), `total_surplus_produced`, `interest_payments`, `ground_rent`, `taxes_on_surplus`, all `ge=0`); `NoDataSentinel` (`babylon.domain.economics.tensor:45`); `TICK_DYNAMICS_KEY: str = "tick_dynamics"` (`babylon.domain.economics.tick.graph_bridge:38`) and the `"year"` entry the bridge writes into that dict alongside `"county_states"` (`graph_bridge.py:61` — the ONLY tick-year source available to this System; `MarketScissorsSystem` receives a `tick`, never a calendar year).
- Produces: `_mean_ratio_to_capital(graph, numerator_attr) -> float | None` — a new module-level helper reused unchanged by Task U6.7 for the debt term.
- Produces: `_national_serviceability(graph) -> float | None` — the production consumer of `serviceability_anchor`. `_mean_ratio_to_capital(graph, numerator_attr)` is RETAINED and reused by U6.7 for `tick_accumulated_debt`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

First add the new imports to `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py`, directly below the existing `from babylon.config.defines import GameDefines, MarketDefines` line and above `from babylon.engine.context import TickContext` (`babylon.config` < `babylon.domain` < `babylon.engine`; Ruff's isort will confirm):

```python
from babylon.domain.economics.distribution.types import SurplusValueDistribution
from babylon.domain.economics.dynamics.types import ClassDistribution
from babylon.domain.economics.tick.graph_bridge import TICK_DYNAMICS_KEY
from babylon.domain.economics.tick.types import CountyEconomicState
```

Then add the `_county_with` helper at module level, placed directly after `_county_worker` (currently ending around line 216) and before `class TestCountyAxis:`. It is deliberately narrower than U5.7's `_county` in `tests/unit/dialectics/` — that one is a different file, and this task only needs the interest/surplus pair:

```python
def _county_with(*, surplus: float, interest: float) -> CountyEconomicState:
    """A published county state carrying only the surplus/interest pair.

    Every other field is a fixed, valid filler: this fixture exists to feed
    `_national_serviceability`, which reads `surplus_distribution` alone.
    `ClassDistribution` enforces sum-to-one within 0.001, so the five shares
    are not free parameters.
    """
    return CountyEconomicState(
        fips="26163",
        year=2015,
        capital_stock=1.0e9,

            lumpenproletariat_share=0.15,
        ),
        phi_hour=3.5,
        surplus_distribution=SurplusValueDistribution(
            fips_code="26163",

            ground_rent=0.0,
            taxes_on_surplus=0.0,
        ),
    )
```

Then add the test to `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py`, inside `class TestCorrection:` (after the test added in Task U6.1):

```python
    def test_interest_burden_tightens_the_threshold_into_a_snap(self) -> None:

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py::TestCorrection::test_interest_burden_tightens_the_threshold_into_a_snap`
Expected: FAIL — `assert 0 == 1` (serviceable is still `0.55 + 4*0.3 = 1.75 > 1.5`; the interest burden is not yet read, so no correction fires).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py`, add this import block in full, placed directly above the existing `from babylon.engine.systems.wealth_distribution import (` line (`babylon.domain` sorts before `babylon.engine`; within it `distribution` < `monetary` < `tensor` < `tick`; Ruff's isort will confirm). All four symbols are used by the two helpers below — none of them is currently imported by this module:

```python
from babylon.domain.economics.distribution.types import SurplusValueDistribution
from babylon.domain.economics.monetary import serviceability_anchor
from babylon.domain.economics.tensor import NoDataSentinel
from babylon.domain.economics.tick.graph_bridge import TICK_DYNAMICS_KEY
```

(`NoDataSentinel` lands HERE, not in Task U6.8 — U6.8's import block therefore no longer adds it. All four are `domain` imports from `engine`, which the layering rule permits; none of them imports `engine` back, so there is no cycle.)

Add a new module-level helper, placed directly after `_mean_profit_rate` (added in Task U6.1):

```python
def _mean_ratio_to_capital(graph: GraphProtocol, numerator_attr: str) -> float | None:
    """Exact ``Sum(numerator) / Sum(tick_capital_stock)`` over active territories.

    Deliberately NOT :func:`_capital_weighted_mean`: that helper defaults a
    missing weight to 1.0 so weightless fixtures keep their prior unweighted
    reading, whereas this one SKIPS a territory missing either attribute (the
    ratio is undefined without capital). Two different absence policies, two
    helpers — do not merge them without re-pinning both call sites' fixtures.

    Weighting each territory's own ``numerator/capital`` ratio by its
    capital stock telescopes algebraically to this sum-of-sums — the exact
    national aggregate, not an approximation, and dimensionally consistent
    with ``tick_profit_rate`` (also normalized to ``c+v``). Territories
    missing either attribute, or carrying non-positive capital (the ratio
    is undefined), are skipped — honest absence (III.11), never a
    fabricated zero. Sorted-id iteration fixes the float summation order
    (III.7).
    """
    numerator_total = 0.0
    capital_total = 0.0
    for node in sorted(graph.query_nodes(node_type="territory"), key=lambda n: n.id):
        attrs = node.attributes
        if not attrs.get("active", True):
            continue
        numerator = attrs.get(numerator_attr)
        capital = attrs.get("tick_capital_stock")
        if not isinstance(numerator, (int, float)) or not isinstance(capital, (int, float)):
            continue
        if capital <= 0.0:

        numerator_total += float(numerator)
        capital_total += float(capital)
    return numerator_total / capital_total if capital_total > 0.0 else None
```

```python
def _national_serviceability(graph: GraphProtocol) -> float | None:
    """National interest burden ``Σi / Σs``, via ``serviceability_anchor``.

    never a mean of per-county burdens (the intensive-aggregation class).

    honest-absence contract (§3.3 clause 1) is the single source of the
    absent/present decision; a ``NoDataSentinel`` resolves to ``None`` and the
    interest term drops out of ``calculate_serviceable_divergence`` entirely.

    The aggregate is stamped with the REAL tick year, read from the same
    ``tick_dynamics["year"]`` entry the bridge writes alongside
    ``county_states``. No invented constant: a hardcoded year would be an
    inline coefficient with no material referent (Aleksandrov Test), and a

The national interest burden i/s — the share of produced surplus already
spoken for, aggregated as a ratio of sums over the published county
SurplusValueDistributions and resolved by serviceability_anchor — tightens
the serviceable divergence independent of the profit rate. Not interest
over capital stock: the claim is on surplus, not on capital.

### Task U6.7: Wire the accumulated-debt term into correction severity

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py:34-41` (import block), the `_maybe_correct` method (as modified by Task U6.6)
- Test: `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `calculate_correction_severity` (U6.2/U6.3), `defines.correction_debt_slope` (U6.5), `_mean_ratio_to_capital` (U6.6), per-territory `tick_accumulated_debt` (already stamped, `graph_bridge.py`'s Feature-024 block) and `tick_capital_stock`.
- Produces: nothing new for later units — this closes item 2 of §3.5.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Add to `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py`, inside `class TestCorrection:` (after the test added in Task U6.6):

```python
    def test_accumulated_debt_deepens_the_snap(self) -> None:
        """A debt-free bubble snaps at the base severity (0.6 — see
        test_overhang_fires_the_snap). The SAME overhang, SAME capital
        stock, carrying a debt-to-capital ratio of 1.0 closes MORE of the
        fictitious log-ratio in the same single snap (§3.5 item 2). Capital
        stock is held constant across both arms so the only varying input
        is debt — otherwise the U6.1 capital-weighted profit aggregate and
        the C-5 serviceability denominator move too, and the test would not
        isolate severity."""
        debt_free = _euphoric_graph()
        debt_free.update_node("metropole", tick_capital_stock=10.0)
        _step(debt_free, _enabled_services(), tick=10)
        debt_free_after = debt_free.graph["market"]["fictitious_log"]

        indebted = _euphoric_graph()
        indebted.update_node("metropole", tick_capital_stock=10.0, tick_accumulated_debt=10.0)
        _step(indebted, _enabled_services(), tick=10)
        indebted_after = indebted.graph["market"]["fictitious_log"]

        assert debt_free_after == pytest.approx(0.6)  # base severity 0.6 on a 1.5 overhang
        assert indebted_after < debt_free_after
        assert indebted_after == pytest.approx(0.0)  # severity clamps to 1.0: full wipeout
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py::TestCorrection::test_accumulated_debt_deepens_the_snap`
Expected: FAIL — `assert 0.6 == pytest.approx(0.0)` (both runs snap at the base severity 0.6 since the debt ratio is not yet read; `1.5 * (1 - 0.6) = 0.6` in both cases, so `indebted_after < debt_free_after` is also false — `0.6 < 0.6` fails).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Update the `formulas.market` import block in `src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py` to:

```python
from babylon.formulas.market import (
    calculate_correction_severity,
    calculate_correction_snap,
    calculate_ema,
    calculate_growth_drive,
    calculate_overhang,
    calculate_scissors_step,
    calculate_serviceable_divergence,
)
```

In `_maybe_correct`, locate the block (as left by Task U6.6):

```python
        fictitious_log, fictitious_velocity = calculate_correction_snap(
            state.fictitious_log,
            state.fictitious_velocity,
            severity=defines.correction_severity,
        )
        price_log, price_velocity = calculate_correction_snap(
            state.price_log,
            state.price_velocity,
            severity=defines.correction_price_severity,
        )
```

and replace it with:

```python
        debt_ratio = _mean_ratio_to_capital(graph, "tick_accumulated_debt")
        severity = calculate_correction_severity(
            defines.correction_severity, debt_ratio=debt_ratio, slope=defines.correction_debt_slope
        )
        fictitious_log, fictitious_velocity = calculate_correction_snap(
            state.fictitious_log,
            state.fictitious_velocity,
            severity=severity,
        )
        price_log, price_velocity = calculate_correction_snap(
            state.price_log,
            state.price_velocity,
            severity=defines.correction_price_severity,
        )
```

(Only the fictitious-capital snap's severity is debt-adjusted — the price snap keeps `defines.correction_price_severity` unchanged; the debt spiral is a claims-side phenomenon, not a general price-deflation one.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py::TestCorrection`
Expected: PASS for the entire class, including `test_correction_is_deterministic` and every other pre-existing case in `TestCorrection` (unaffected: `_euphoric_graph()`'s default territories carry no `tick_accumulated_debt`, so `debt_ratio` is `None` and `calculate_correction_severity` returns `defines.correction_severity` unchanged — bit-identical to pre-U6.7 behavior).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(market): wire the accumulated-debt term into correction severity

A debt spiral (tick_accumulated_debt / tick_capital_stock, exactly
aggregated) deepens the fictitious-capital snap's severity, clamped
to [0, 1]. Closes §3.5 item 2.

### Task U6.8: Wire the D1 monetary anchor into the fictitious oscillator

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py:26-52` (module header + imports), the `step` method (currently lines 133-166), the `_advance` staticmethod (currently lines 233-283)
- Test: `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR: Final[str] = "national_financial"` (U3, `babylon.domain.economics.tick.graph_bridge`), `NationalFinancialParameters` (already exists, `babylon.domain.economics.tick.types`), `fictitious_anchor(stock: FictitiousCapitalStock | None, real_output: float | None) -> float | NoDataSentinel` (U4, `babylon.domain.economics.monetary.anchor`), `NoDataSentinel` (`babylon.domain.economics.tensor`), `calculate_anchor_pull` (U6.4), `defines.anchor_pull` (U6.5).
- Produces: `_read_fictitious_anchor(metadata, real_output) -> float | None` — module-level helper, used only by `step()`. `MarketScissorsSystem._advance(..., anchor: float | None = None)` — the new keyword gets a default so `_step_county_axes`'s existing calls (which must **not** receive the anchor — no per-territory `fictitious_log` projection, out of scope per §6) continue to work unmodified.

- [ ] **Step 0: Measure the pre-wiring pin values (do this BEFORE writing any test)**

```bash
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" poetry run python -c "
from babylon.config.defines.market import MarketDefines
from babylon.models.market import MarketState
from babylon.engine.systems.market_scissors import MarketScissorsSystem
prior = MarketState(price_log=0.12, price_velocity=-0.01, fictitious_log=0.4,
                    fictitious_velocity=0.02, surplus_ema=3.5, value_ema=11.0, tick=42)
r = MarketScissorsSystem._advance(prior, 4.0, 12.0, MarketDefines(), 43)
for f in ('price_log','price_velocity','fictitious_log','fictitious_velocity','surplus_ema','value_ema'):
    print(f'        assert result.{f} == {getattr(r, f)!r}')
"
```
Paste the six printed lines verbatim into `TestAnchorAbsentIsBitIdentical`. **Do not hand-type them and do not accept the literals as printed in this plan** — they were authored, not measured. If any differs, the CAPTURED value is authoritative; do not adjust the implementation to match the plan.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Add the new imports to the top of `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py` (extend the existing import block):

```python
from babylon.domain.economics.credit.types import FictitiousCapitalStock
from babylon.domain.economics.tick.graph_bridge import NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR
from babylon.domain.economics.tick.types import NationalFinancialParameters
```

Add two new test classes at the end of `tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py`:

```python

    """U6/D1: absence of NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR must reproduce the exact
    pre-U6.8 trajectory — captured before the anchor-pull wiring landed."""

    def test_advance_without_an_anchor_matches_the_pre_u6_pin(self) -> None:

            fictitious_log=0.4,
            fictitious_velocity=0.02,
            surplus_ema=3.5,
            value_ema=11.0,
            tick=42,
        )
        result = MarketScissorsSystem._advance(
            prior, surplus=4.0, value=12.0, defines=defines, tick=43, anchor=None
        )
        assert result.price_log == 0.16364545454545454

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py::TestAnchorAbsentIsBitIdentical`
Expected: FAIL with `TypeError: _advance() got an unexpected keyword argument 'anchor'` — the six float assertions are NOT exercised on this run; they only become live after Step 3.

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py::TestAnchorPresentPullsTheOscillator::test_anchor_pulls_the_fictitious_log_upward`
Expected: FAIL — `assert 0.0 > 0.0` (with `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR` not yet read by `step()`, the anchored and unanchored runs are identical: both `0.0`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `src/babylon/engine/systems/market_scissors.py`, update the top-of-file imports (currently lines 26-52) to add:

```python
from babylon.domain.economics.monetary import fictitious_anchor
from babylon.domain.economics.tick.graph_bridge import NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR
from babylon.domain.economics.tick.types import NationalFinancialParameters
```

`NoDataSentinel` is NOT re-added here — Task U6.6 already imported it into this module for `_national_serviceability`, and `fictitious_anchor` reuses that same binding. Merge `fictitious_anchor` into U6.6's existing `from babylon.domain.economics.monetary import serviceability_anchor` line (making it `from babylon.domain.economics.monetary import fictitious_anchor, serviceability_anchor`) and `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR` into U6.6's existing `from babylon.domain.economics.tick.graph_bridge import TICK_DYNAMICS_KEY` line, rather than writing duplicate `from` statements; the remaining new line is placed alphabetically before the existing `from babylon.engine.systems.wealth_distribution import (...)` line, and add `calculate_anchor_pull` to the existing `formulas.market` import block:

```python
from babylon.formulas.market import (
    calculate_anchor_pull,
    calculate_correction_severity,
    calculate_correction_snap,
    calculate_ema,
    calculate_growth_drive,
    calculate_overhang,
    calculate_scissors_step,
    calculate_serviceable_divergence,
)
```

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/engine/systems/test_market_system.py`
Expected: PASS for the entire file — the two new classes, and every pre-existing test in `TestDynamics`, `TestCorrection`, `TestCountyAxis`, etc. (all call `step()`/`_advance()` on graphs with no `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR` key, so `anchor` resolves to `None` throughout and every prior assertion holds bit-identically).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "feat(market): pull the fictitious oscillator toward the D1 monetary anchor

_advance reads NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR (U3) and, when
fictitious_anchor (U4) resolves a real value, adds a proportional pull
term to the fictitious drive; NoDataSentinel or an absent key leaves
dynamics bit-identical to pre-U6.8 (pinned exactly). County axes never
receive the anchor — no per-territory projection, out of scope.
Closes §3.5 item 3 and the U6 acceptance criteria.

### Task U7.0: Empirical determinism proof — two independent processes, per-tick construction cadence

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/unit/tools/test_regression_construction_cadence_determinism.py`
- Test: `tests/unit/tools/test_regression_construction_cadence_determinism.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `tools/regression_test.py`'s `generate --scenario <name> --dense --output <dir>` CLI (existing, `tools/regression_test.py:1107-1126`); indirectly exercises `tests/fixtures/vol3_fred_series.json` (U1) via the `calculator_overrides` U1 threads into `step()` at `tools/regression_test.py`'s scenario-run call site (was line 585 pre-U1: `state = step(state, sim_config, persistent_context, defines)`); exercises `ServiceContainer.create(config, effective_defines, **overrides)` (`src/babylon/engine/simulation_engine.py:527`).
- Produces: nothing consumed downstream — this is a standalone empirical proof, run once as evidence for U8's ceremony gate. Its PASS is cited in `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md` (U8.3) as the answer to design §5 hazard 2.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
"""Empirical proof that the per-tick ServiceContainer.create(**overrides)
cadence (simulation_engine.py:527) is deterministic across independent OS
processes, now that tools/regression_test.py threads Vol III financial
calculator_overrides through it (U1, D4's committed FRED fixture).

Design spec 2026-07-18-vol3-money-scissors-design.md section 5, hazard 2:
"Same-inputs -> same-outputs across every construction site must be
verified EMPIRICALLY before U7, not inferred from reading code. ADR056's
precedent applies: the planned determinism proof was wrong and only an
empirical run caught it." ADR056 (spec-102) found that a determinism check
performed by re-running the SAME interpreter in-process, or by comparing a
hash that turned out to embed run-scoped state, both gave false confidence.
This test follows that precedent literally: it spawns two genuinely
separate ``python`` processes (never two in-process calls, which would
share one PYTHONHASHSEED and could hide a hash-randomization-dependent
set/dict iteration-order bug) and byte-compares their output. Per
.mise.toml and tests/conftest.py, BLAS thread counts are pinned to 1 for
determinism but PYTHONHASHSEED is deliberately left unpinned — each
subprocess below gets Python's normal fresh random hash seed, so a
byte-identical result here is real cross-process evidence, not an artifact
of test isolation.

Expected: FAIL — the byte-comparison reports a divergence, proving it reads the
artifact it claims to compare rather than passing vacuously. (A missing file is
NOT a red phase.)
**Restore `_run_generate` to its Step 1 form before Step 4.**

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
The test file written in Step 1 IS the deliverable — there is no separate production code to add. Save the exact file from Step 1 at `tests/unit/tools/test_regression_construction_cadence_determinism.py`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/tools/test_regression_construction_cadence_determinism.py`
Expected: PASS. Record the actual pytest output verbatim (not summarized) as the empirical evidence line in `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md`'s Verification Evidence section (U8.3) — e.g. `1 passed in 4.82s`. If it FAILS, STOP: this means U1-U7 introduced real non-determinism (most likely a `set`/`dict`-over-unsorted-keys iteration inside one of the new Vol III calculator paths, or a hash-seed-sensitive FRED-fixture lookup) — this is a defect to fix before proceeding to U8.2, not a baseline to accept.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "test(tools): empirical two-process determinism proof for the per-tick ServiceContainer cadence

ADR056 precedent: the planned determinism proof was wrong and only an
empirical run caught it. Two independent OS processes, unpinned

### Task U7.3: Liveness registry — declared outputs and their readers

**Files:**
- Create: `src/babylon/sentinels/liveness/__init__.py`
- Create: `src/babylon/sentinels/liveness/registry.py`
- Test: `tests/unit/sentinels/test_liveness_registry.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing (pure Pydantic data)
- Produces: `babylon.sentinels.liveness.registry.LivenessRow` and `LIVENESS_ROWS: tuple[LivenessRow, ...]` — consumed by U7.4 and U7.5.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
"""Tests for the declared liveness registry (correct-but-inert / never-consumed).

The registry is the *declared* half of the two liveness sensors: every output a
production producer stamps is either claimed by at least one production consumer
file, or explicitly declared dormant WITH A REASON. There is no third state —
that is the whole point of the class this gate exists to catch.

No test detected it, because "it runs" and "it matters" are different claims and
only the first was ever asserted. This sentinel asserts the second.

Two error classes, one registry:

- **correct-but-inert** — a producer (a ``System``, a service) runs but *every*
  output it declares is dormant; the whole producer is decoration.
- **computed-but-never-consumed** — one declared output has no production
  reader, and no ``dormant_reason`` explaining why that is acceptable.

The registry (:mod:`babylon.sentinels.liveness.registry`) is the declared half;
the sensors (:mod:`babylon.sentinels.liveness.checks`) prove each declaration
against source, statically, via :mod:`ast`. Per the standing owner ruling both
checks are **advisory** and local/on-demand

is legitimate (scaffolding awaiting its consumer) but only when *declared*, so

- **Efficacy (MUTATION)** — the sensor REDS when the defect it exists to catch
  is injected: a declared consumer that does not in fact read the output, i.e.

### Task U7.7: Coupling dependency registry

**Files:**
- Create: `src/babylon/sentinels/coupling/__init__.py`
- Create: `src/babylon/sentinels/coupling/registry.py`
- Test: `tests/unit/sentinels/test_coupling_registry.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the U5 opposition keys `surplus_distribution`, `debt_spiral`, `credit`, `financial` and the U5 `GraphInputs` fields `rentier_share`, `debt_ratio`, `credit_fragility`, `financialization_index`
- Produces: `MeasurementDependency`, `MEASUREMENT_DEPENDENCIES: tuple[MeasurementDependency, ...]`, `dependency_for(key)` — consumed by U7.8.

**DECLARED LIMITATION — direction B is inert on this registry as seeded.** All five rows below
name the same `producer_file` (`_CONTRADICTION`), and U7.8's
`check_real_dependencies_are_declared` skips every pair whose two rows share a producer file (a
same-file pair mentions the sibling's symbols trivially, so a mention proves nothing). Every
ordered pair of these five rows is therefore skipped, and
`test_real_dependencies_are_all_declared` passes **vacuously** — it asserts `[]` against a loop
body that never executes. This is the correct-but-inert error class appearing inside the very
program that ships the correct-but-inert sensor, so it is declared here rather than discovered
later: declared-and-deferred is acceptable, silently-inert is not.

Direction B is retained, not deleted, because it is a **guard against future rows**: the moment
one opposition's inputs are produced somewhere other than `contradiction.py` — U6's monetary
anchor (`domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py`), a future `market_scissors.py`-produced field, any
new System that computes a `GraphInputs` field — that row pairs against the five existing ones
with a different `producer_file`, the skip no longer fires, and the check goes live with no code
change. Its efficacy is proven today by U7.8's injected-fixture mutation tests, which supply rows
with two different producer files; that is what keeps a currently-inert check from rotting into a
broken one. What would make it live on the real registry: a second distinct `producer_file` among
the declared rows.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
"""Tests for the declared measurement-dependency registry.

The coupling graph is a claim ABOUT THE CODE: "``surplus_distribution``
transforms ``debt_spiral``" asserts that the thing computing the debt reading

measure reads, which file produces them, and which symbols that file publishes.

### Task U7.8: undeclared-coupling sensor — both directions + mutation proofs

**Files:**
- Create: `src/babylon/sentinels/coupling/checks.py`
- Modify: `tools/sentinel_check.py` (import + `_SENSORS` entry, beside the `aggregation` entry from U7.6)
- Modify: `.mise.toml` (append after the `check:aggregation` block from U7.6)
- Test: `tests/unit/sentinels/test_coupling_sentinel.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `babylon.sentinels._ast.coupling_edges`, `babylon.sentinels._ast.referenced_names`, `babylon.sentinels.coupling.registry.MEASUREMENT_DEPENDENCIES`, `babylon.sentinels.report.finding`
- Produces: `check_declared_edges_are_grounded(...)`, `check_real_dependencies_are_declared(...)`, `babylon.sentinels.coupling.checks.main`, CLI sensor name `coupling`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
"""Tests for the undeclared-coupling sensor (both directions).

- **Invariant** — on the real catalog + registry, every declared edge between
  two registered oppositions is grounded in a real read, and every real read
  between two registered oppositions is declared.
- **Efficacy (MUTATION)** — direction A reds on an edge whose target's producer
  reads nothing the source publishes; direction B reds on a real read with no
  declaring edge.

- Modify: `src/babylon/sentinels/coverage/registry.py` (append the `GateEstate` model and `GATE_ESTATES` literal after `DATA_REQUIREMENTS`)
- Modify: `src/babylon/sentinels/coverage/checks.py:210-216` (the `_ADVISORY_CHECKS` tuple, currently `()`) and append `check_gate_estate_coverage`
- Test: `tests/unit/sentinels/test_gate_blindness.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `babylon.sentinels._ast.returned_dict_keys`, `babylon.sentinels._ast.referenced_names`, `babylon.sentinels.report.finding`
- Produces: `GateEstate`, `GATE_ESTATES`, `check_gate_estate_coverage(estates=GATE_ESTATES) -> list[str]`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python

Sentinel error classes
======================

Five named failure classes, each with a sensor that finds it. All five are
**advisory** and **local/on-demand** — they print loudly, they never gate CI.
Run one with ``mise run check:<name>`` or
``poetry run python tools/sentinel_check.py <sensor>``.

Every finding renders in one line::

    [<error-class>] <symbol> @ <file>:<line> — <problem> | REMEDY: <remedy>

correct-but-inert
-----------------

A producer runs, its models validate, and nothing downstream changes because it
ran. Volume III's entire estate was in this state: eleven calculators executing
correctly at every year boundary, reaching nothing.

:Sensor: ``babylon.sentinels.liveness.checks.check_producers_are_not_inert``
:Registry: ``babylon.sentinels.liveness.registry.LIVENESS_ROWS``
:Run: ``mise run check:liveness``
:Remedy: wire one output to a production consumer, or retire the producer.

computed-but-never-consumed
---------------------------

One declared output has no production reader and no declared reason. ``Path A``
ground rent, ``FictitiousCapitalStock``, ``DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD`` and
``pole_readings`` were all here. Dormancy is legitimate — *undeclared* dormancy
is not.

:Sensor: ``babylon.sentinels.liveness.checks.check_outputs_have_readers``
:Run: ``mise run check:liveness``
:Remedy: add a real consumer, or set ``dormant_reason`` on the registry row.

gate-blindness
--------------

A gate is green and blind: its harness never executes the estate it claims to
guard. ``qa:regression`` — the project's Definition of Done — injected no
economics calculators at all, so its byte-identical baselines never ran a line
of Volumes I, II or III.

:Sensor: ``babylon.sentinels.coverage.checks.check_gate_estate_coverage``
:Registry: ``babylon.sentinels.coverage.registry.GATE_ESTATES``
:Run: ``mise run check:coverage``
:Remedy: build the harness's overrides from a committed deterministic fixture,
   or narrow the claim with ``exempt_keys`` **and** an ``exempt_reason``.

intensive-aggregation
---------------------

An unweighted mean of a rate, ratio, share, balance or index across space or
class. The aggregate profit rate is ``Σs / Σ(c+v)``, never ``mean(rᵢ)``: the
unweighted form lets a four-hundred-person county swing a national threshold as
hard as Wayne County.

:Sensor: ``babylon.sentinels.aggregation.checks.check_no_unweighted_intensive_means``
:Registry: ``babylon.sentinels.aggregation.registry``
:Run: ``mise run check:aggregation``
:Remedy: aggregate numerator and denominator separately, or declare an
   ``AggregationExemption`` with the reason equal weighting is materially right.

undeclared-coupling
-------------------

The coupling graph is a claim about the code, and claims drift. Checked in
**both** directions: an edge with no real read behind it (declared-but-absent),
and a real read with no edge declaring it (present-but-undeclared). Four reserved
edges sat dormant for months; ``momentum_coupling`` was a real dependency nobody
had written down.

:Sensor: ``babylon.sentinels.coupling.checks`` (both directions)
:Registry: ``babylon.sentinels.coupling.registry.MEASUREMENT_DEPENDENCIES``
:Run: ``mise run check:coupling``
:Remedy: wire the dependency the edge claims, delete the edge, or declare the
   edge that the real read already implies.

ADR082_sentinel_error_classes:
  status: "accepted"
  date: "2026-07-18"
  title: "Five named sentinel error classes ship as advisory local sensors"
  context: >
    The Volume III money work surfaced five distinct failure classes that no
    existing test detected: an entire estate computing correctly and changing
    nothing (correct-but-inert); individual outputs with no reader
    (computed-but-never-consumed); the Definition-of-Done gate running green while
    executing none of the estate it claimed to guard (gate-blindness); an
    unweighted mean of an intensive across space (intensive-aggregation); and a
    coupling graph whose declared edges had drifted from the dependencies they
    described, in both directions (undeclared-coupling). Four were already on the
    owed-sentinel list; the fifth is new and generalises the governing principle
    that a coupling graph must be verified against code, not merely declared.
  decision: >
    Ship one sensor per class in the babylon.sentinels family — new packages
    liveness/, aggregation/, coupling/, plus a gate-blindness check extending the
    existing coverage/ package. All five are ADVISORY and local/on-demand per the
    standing owner ruling: no nightly CI plumbing, no gating. Each finding is
    agent-legible through a shared formatter (error class, symbol, file:line,
    problem, remedy) and each sensor ships a mutation test that injects the defect
    it exists to catch and proves the sensor reds.
  consequences: >
    The four owed classes are struck from the owed list. New mise tasks
    check:liveness, check:aggregation, check:coupling; check:coverage gains an
    advisory tier. The registries are hand-written dev-time contracts and must be
    grown as producers and couplings are added — an undeclared output or edge is
    the drift the sensors exist to surface, so growth is the point, not overhead.

### Task U8.2: Capture the qa:regression RED diff as evidence

**Files:**
- Create: `tools/capture_qa_diff.py`
- Test: `tests/unit/tools/test_capture_qa_diff.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `tools/regression_test.py compare` (the exact command `.mise.toml`'s `[tasks."qa:regression"]` runs: `poetry run python tools/regression_test.py compare`, `.mise.toml:730`).
- Produces: `reports/vol3-baseline-delta-raw-diff.txt` (real qa:regression output, RED) and `reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt` (real `qa:e2e-regression` output) — both consumed by U8.3's report authoring.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
"""Unit tests for tools/capture_qa_diff.py (U8.2's evidence-capture tool).

Mocks subprocess.run so this test is fast and independent of the engine's
actual current pass/fail state -- the REAL capture (this repo's real
qa:regression output, expected RED per design D3) happens in Step 4/5 of
this task by running the tool for real, not by this test.

Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/tools/test_capture_qa_diff.py`
Expected: PASS (2 passed).
- [ ] **Step 5: Capture the REAL diff (not mocked) — this is the actual U8.2 deliverable**
Run, in order, against the real repo state (U1-U7 already landed on this branch):
```bash
poetry run python tools/capture_qa_diff.py; echo "exit=$?"
```
Expected: `exit=1` (RED). If `exit=0`, STOP — U1-U7's wiring produced zero behavioral difference across all 5 checkpoint scenarios, which contradicts the design's own diagnosis (§1.1: "s = p + i + r + t never evaluates in the shipped game" is being fixed) and needs investigation before continuing, not silent acceptance. Then capture the e2e leg too (per the design's §5 note that U1 wires the headless-runner path as well, so `qa:e2e-regression` may also have drifted):
```bash
mise run qa:e2e-regression > reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt 2>&1; echo "exit=$?" >> reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt
```
Record both exit codes verbatim — U8.3 needs the real value, not an assumption. (Program 23's precedent, ADR078: the 5-tick e2e leg was unaffected because no correction was reachable in 5 ticks; Vol III's annual/52-tick cadence for `FictitiousCapitalStock` may or may not fire inside a 5-tick run depending on whether tick 0 counts as a year boundary — do not assume either way, read the captured file.)
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(tools): capture qa:regression + qa:e2e-regression RED diff as U8.2 evidence

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```
Note: `reports/vol3-baseline-delta-raw-diff.txt` and `reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt` ARE committed here (they are the raw evidence artifacts U8.3 quotes from) — this is a docs/evidence commit, not the baseline-regeneration ceremony commit (that is U8.5, and stays strictly separate per the design's D3 ruling and the ADR077/078 precedent of a dedicated ceremony commit).

### Task U8.3: Author `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md`

**Files:**
- Create: `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md`
- Test: `tests/unit/tools/test_vol3_baseline_delta_report.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `reports/vol3-baseline-delta-raw-diff.txt` + `reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt` (U8.2, real captured output); `tools/regression_test.py`'s `SCENARIOS` dict (`tools/regression_test.py:100-134`) as the canonical scenario name/description list; U7.0's determinism-proof PASS evidence; the binding-contract symbol names from U1-U7 (`NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR`, `fictitious_anchor`/`serviceability_anchor`, the four new opposition keys `surplus_distribution`/`debt_spiral`/`credit`/`financial`, the new `MarketDefines` fields) as the vocabulary the "named mechanism" column must cite.
- Produces: the document U8.4's owner-approval gate is read against, and the document U8.5's ceremony commit message summarizes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
```python
"""Structural contract for reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md (U8.3).

exist once someone has actually run qa:regression against the real U1-U7

# Vol III Money — Baseline Delta

**Status:** DRAFT — pending owner approval (see "Owner Approval Gate" below)
**Design:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-vol3-money-scissors-design.md`
**Precedent:** ADR077/ADR078 (Program 23 Market Scissors) — the same
"prove the delta in writing, then regenerate baselines in a dedicated
ceremony commit" pattern (D3 owner ruling here mirrors that precedent
explicitly).
**Raw evidence:** `reports/vol3-baseline-delta-raw-diff.txt` (qa:regression),
`reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt` (qa:e2e-regression) — both
captured verbatim by U8.2, real output from this branch, not paraphrased.

## Why this document exists

Constitution III.7's falsifiability gate (`qa:regression`) is expected to go
RED the moment U1-U7 land: `s = p + i + r + t` has never evaluated in the
shipped game before this branch (design spec §1.1), so turning it on is a
genuine behavioral change, not a bug. D3 requires that change to be
explained, per scenario, by a *named mechanism* — never "values shifted" —
before any baseline is regenerated.

## Verification evidence

| Check | Command | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-tick construction cadence determinism | `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/tools/test_regression_construction_cadence_determinism.py` | `<FILL: PASS, N passed in Ns>` | U7.0 (pre-U7 run) + U8.5 Step 5 (post-regeneration re-run) |
| qa:regression (checkpoint + dense) | `mise run qa:regression` | `<FILL: N passed, M failed>` | `reports/vol3-baseline-delta-raw-diff.txt` |
| qa:e2e-regression (detroit-tri-county, 5 ticks) | `mise run qa:e2e-regression` | `<FILL: PASS or FAIL>` | `reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt` |
| `mise run check:quick` (lint+format+typecheck) | `mise run check:quick` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL: paste tail of output>` |
| Scoped unit sweep over every U1-U7 touched path | `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/economics tests/unit/dialectics tests/unit/engine tests/unit/config tests/unit/sentinels tests/unit/tools tests/unit/formulas` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL: paste tail of output>` |

## Per-scenario delta

Each section below MUST name the mechanism from the design's layer
structure (§3.1-3.5) that produced the delta — citing the actual symbol
(e.g. `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR`, `fictitious_anchor`, the `surplus_distribution`
opposition key, `MarketDefines.anchor_pull`) — not a restatement that a
number changed.

### imperial_circuit

**Description:** 4-node default scenario (`tools/regression_test.py` SCENARIOS).

| Field | Before (pre-Vol III) | After (this branch) | Named mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| First checkpoint tick with a value delta | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| `final_outcome` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| `ticks_survived` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| Correction fired differently (tick, if any) | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL: interest-burden term (§3.5.1) / debt-accumulation term (§3.5.2) / anchor pull (§3.3) — cite which>` |
| Principal contradiction at terminal tick | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL: did surplus_distribution / debt_spiral / credit / financial displace the prior principal? Design Risk #4>` |
| First dense-trace divergence (tick, column) | n/a | `<FILL: from tests/baselines/dense/imperial_circuit.csv comparison>` | `<FILL>` |

**Materiality argument:** `<FILL — must cite a real mechanism, e.g. "tick_ground_rent now reads DefaultDistributionCalculator's real B230RC0Q173SBEA-backed figure instead of the DefaultRentCalculator NoDataSentinel it silently fell back to before (design §3.1 Path A/B correction), so the surplus_distribution opposition's rentier_share measure goes non-zero for the first time in this scenario's history">`

### two_node

**Description:** Minimal worker vs owner (`tools/regression_test.py` SCENARIOS).

| Field | Before | After | Named mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| First checkpoint tick with a value delta | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| `final_outcome` / `ticks_survived` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| Correction fired differently | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| Principal contradiction at terminal tick | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| First dense-trace divergence | n/a | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |

**Materiality argument:** `<FILL — if this scenario has no county/territory FIPS data (its Territory nodes carry no county_fips, per src/babylon/models/entities/territory.py), the honest expectation may be NO delta beyond opposition_states key-set growth 6->10 (design §3.4, D2) and defines_hash. State plainly which is actually observed — do not assume, read the raw diff.>`

### starvation

**Description:** Low extraction efficiency stress (`tools/regression_test.py` SCENARIOS).

| Field | Before | After | Named mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| First checkpoint tick with a value delta | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| `final_outcome` / `ticks_survived` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| Correction fired differently | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| Principal contradiction at terminal tick | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| First dense-trace divergence | n/a | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |

**Materiality argument:** `<FILL>`

### glut

**Description:** High extraction with metabolic overshoot (`tools/regression_test.py` SCENARIOS).

| Field | Before | After | Named mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| First checkpoint tick with a value delta | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| `final_outcome` / `ticks_survived` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| Correction fired differently | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| Principal contradiction at terminal tick | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| First dense-trace divergence | n/a | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |

**Materiality argument:** `<FILL>`

### fascist_bifurcation

**Description:** Consciousness routing to national identity (`tools/regression_test.py` SCENARIOS).

| Field | Before | After | Named mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| First checkpoint tick with a value delta | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| `final_outcome` / `ticks_survived` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| Correction fired differently | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| Principal contradiction at terminal tick | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |
| First dense-trace divergence | n/a | `<FILL>` | `<FILL>` |

**Materiality argument:** `<FILL>`

## qa:e2e-regression (detroit-tri-county, 5 ticks)

`<FILL: PASS/FAIL, and if it drifted, the same table shape as above scoped
to the 5-tick window. If PASS UNCHANGED, state which mechanism explains why
(e.g. "Vol III's national financial state is only recomputed at a 52-tick
year boundary (design §1.2 cadence table); a 5-tick window never crosses
one" — cite the actual code path, do not assume).>`

## Risks realized vs mitigated (design spec §7)

| Risk | Realized? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| #1 turning on never-executed code surfaces latent bugs | `<FILL>` | `<FILL: any ValidationError, unexpected NoDataSentinel, or crash hit during U8.2's run?>` |
| #4 catalog growth 6->10 changes principal-contradiction ranking | `<FILL>` | `<FILL: which scenarios saw a principal-contradiction change, per the per-scenario tables above>` |

## Owner Approval Gate

> **STOP. Do not proceed to baseline regeneration (U8.5) past this point
> without an explicit, recorded owner approval below.**
>
> This report is the complete, factual record of every behavioral delta
> `qa:regression` and `qa:e2e-regression` will encode as the new baseline.
> Once regenerated, the old (pre-Vol-III) baseline is gone from
> `tests/baselines/` — recoverable only via git history. The owner must
> read the per-scenario tables above and affirmatively approve *in this
> file* before U8.5 runs.

**Approved by:** `<FILL — leave blank until real sign-off; do not
pre-fill with a placeholder name>`
**Date:** `<FILL>`
**Approval text (verbatim):** `<FILL — quote the owner's actual approval
message, per the ADR078 precedent of quoting the owner's exact words as
the authorization record>`

## Post-approval regeneration record

`<FILL by U8.5 — the ceremony commit hash and a one-line confirmation that
qa:regression is green against the newly regenerated baselines.>`
```
- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/tools/test_vol3_baseline_delta_report.py`
Expected: FAIL on test_report_has_no_unfilled_placeholders_outside_the_approval_gate (the skeleton has ~60 markers) — this is the red that Step 5 turns green. The other 4 tests pass.
- [ ] **Step 5: Fill in every `<FILL>` with real data from U8.2's captured diffs**
This step is not optional and is not satisfied by the skeleton alone: open `reports/vol3-baseline-delta-raw-diff.txt` and `reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt`, and for each scenario, read the actual tick/field/value triples the diff reports, then trace each one to its causing mechanism by reading the relevant U1-U7 code (the design spec §3 layer list is the index: Layer 1 = ground-rent repoint, Layer 1b = `NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR` publication, Layer 2 = `fictitious_anchor`/`serviceability_anchor`, Layer 3 = the four new opposition keys, Layer 4 = the scissors interest-burden/debt terms). Re-run `mise run test:q -- tests/unit/tools/test_vol3_baseline_delta_report.py` — all 5 must now pass.
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**
```bash
mise run commit -- "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Task U8.4: OWNER APPROVAL GATE — STOP, do not regenerate baselines past this point

> ## ⛔ STOP — THIS TASK IS A HUMAN CHECKPOINT, NOT A CODE CHANGE ⛔
>
> **No file in this task is written by the engineer executing this plan except the one-line approval record below, and only after real, affirmative sign-off is received.**
>
> Do not run `mise run qa:regression-generate-dense` or any other baseline-regenerating command until this task is explicitly marked done by a human. Do not interpret silence, a general "looks good", or moving on to the next task as approval. Do not skip ahead to U8.5 "to save time" — U8.5's own Step 1 re-checks this gate and must halt if it is not satisfied.

**Files:**
- Modify: `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md` (only the "Owner Approval Gate" section's three `Approved by:` / `Date:` / `Approval text (verbatim):` fields — nothing else in the file changes in this task)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the completed, fully-filled `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md` from U8.3 Step 5.
- Produces: a recorded, quotable approval that U8.5 Step 1 and U8.6's ADR both cite as the authorization for baseline regeneration (matching the ADR078 precedent of recording the owner's exact words as the ceremony's authorization record).

- [ ] **Step 1 (the only step): Present the completed report to Persephone Raskova and obtain explicit written approval**
Send (or otherwise present) the fully-filled `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md` from U8.3 for review. Wait for an explicit response that approves regenerating the baselines — a real message, not an inferred green light. Do not proceed on the basis of prior general approvals of the design spec (§2 "owner decisions" approved the *design*, not this specific delta) — D3 explicitly separates "prove the delta" from "then regenerate," and this gate is where that separation is enforced.

Once received, edit `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md`'s Owner Approval Gate section to fill in:
```markdown
**Approved by:** Persephone Raskova
**Date:** <actual date of approval>
**Approval text (verbatim):** <exact quoted text of the approval message>
```
Commit only this change:
```bash
mise run commit -- "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(reports): record owner approval for vol3 baseline regeneration (U8.4)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**If approval is withheld or the owner requests changes:** stop the plan here, address the requested changes in `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md` (re-run U8.3 Step 5 against the specific concern), and re-present. Do not proceed to U8.5 under any circumstance until this task's commit exists with a real, non-placeholder `Approved by:` line.

---

### Task U8.5: Regenerate baselines in a dedicated ceremony commit

**Files:**
- Modify: `tests/baselines/imperial_circuit.json`, `tests/baselines/two_node.json`, `tests/baselines/starvation.json`, `tests/baselines/glut.json`, `tests/baselines/fascist_bifurcation.json`
- Modify: `tests/baselines/dense/imperial_circuit.csv`, `tests/baselines/dense/two_node.csv`, `tests/baselines/dense/starvation.csv`, `tests/baselines/dense/glut.csv`, `tests/baselines/dense/fascist_bifurcation.csv`
- Modify (only if U8.2's e2e capture showed drift): `tests/baselines/detroit-tri-county-5t.json`
- Test: none new — this task's "test" is re-running the existing gates before and after regeneration (Steps 2 and 4 below).

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `Approved by:` record from U8.4 (Step 1 below re-checks it exists before doing anything else); `mise run qa:regression-generate-dense` (`.mise.toml:736-738`: `poetry run python tools/regression_test.py generate --force --dense`); the `compare-bundle` command's own stale hint text at `tools/regression_test.py:997-998` (`print("  cp <bundle>/summary.json tests/baselines/michigan-e2e.json")`) — **do not follow that printed instruction verbatim**; the correct target for `qa:e2e-regression` is `tests/baselines/detroit-tri-county-5t.json` per `.mise.toml:740-748`, not `michigan-e2e.json` (that filename is a leftover from before the spec-064/spec-086 rescoping documented in `tests/integration/test_ci_gate_baseline_compare.py:20-24`).
- Produces: the new committed baselines every future `qa:regression`/`qa:e2e-regression` run compares against; the commit hash U8.6's ADR cites as evidence.

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify the owner-approval gate is actually satisfied — halt if not**
```bash
grep -A1 "Approved by:" reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md
```
Expected: a real name and date, not `<FILL>` or blank. If this still shows a placeholder, STOP — return to U8.4. Do not proceed.

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the pre-regeneration RED state one more time (this is the "before" of the red/green pair)**
```bash
mise run qa:regression
```
Expected: FAIL (same shape as U8.2's captured evidence — if it now unexpectedly PASSES, something changed between U8.2 and now; investigate before regenerating over a possibly-different state than the one the owner approved).

- [ ] **Step 3: Regenerate the sampled-checkpoint and dense baselines**
```bash
mise run qa:regression-generate-dense
```
Expected output: `OK (<N> ticks, <OUTCOME>) + <scenario>.csv` for all 5 scenarios (`imperial_circuit`, `two_node`, `starvation`, `glut`, `fascist_bifurcation` — the exact set in `tools/regression_test.py:100-134`'s `SCENARIOS`).

If U8.2's `reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt` showed `qa:e2e-regression` also failed, regenerate it too — correctly, at the real target file, not the stale printed hint:

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify GREEN — the "after" of the red/green pair**
```bash
mise run qa:regression
```
Expected: `Results: 5 passed, 0 failed` / `All regression tests passed!`. If `qa:e2e-regression` was regenerated in Step 3, also run:
```bash
mise run qa:e2e-regression
```
Expected: exit 0, `All regression checks passed.`

- [ ] **Step 5: Re-verify determinism post-regeneration (belt-and-suspenders, per ADR078's "Determinism gate re-verified post-flip" precedent)**
```bash
mise run test:q -- tests/unit/tools/test_regression_construction_cadence_determinism.py
```
Expected: PASS (same test from U7.0 — re-running it here proves the newly-regenerated baselines aren't themselves an artifact of a lucky non-deterministic run).

- [ ] **Step 6b: Resolve the e2e clause for the ceremony commit message**
```bash
E2E_CLAUSE=$(grep -q "^exit=0" reports/vol3-e2e-regression-raw-diff.txt \
  && echo "PASS UNCHANGED (never regenerated)" \
  || echo "regenerated in Step 3 and now PASS")
echo "E2E clause: $E2E_CLAUSE"
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit — the dedicated ceremony commit**
```bash
git add tests/baselines/imperial_circuit.json tests/baselines/two_node.json \
  tests/baselines/starvation.json tests/baselines/glut.json \
  tests/baselines/fascist_bifurcation.json tests/baselines/dense/*.csv
# Only if regenerated in Step 3:
git add tests/baselines/detroit-tri-county-5t.json
git commit -m "$(cat <<EOF
feat(economics)!: PROMOTION CEREMONY — Vol III money wired live; all baselines regenerated

Owner-authorized (see reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md "Owner Approval
Gate" for the recorded approval text and date). Per docs/superpowers/
specs/2026-07-18-vol3-money-scissors-design.md D3: U1-U7 landed Vol III
money on by default; this commit is the dedicated ceremony that
regenerates every qa:regression baseline (sampled JSONs + dense goldens,
5 scenarios) after the written per-scenario delta analysis was approved.

Per-scenario drift: see reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md for the full
mechanism-by-mechanism breakdown (ground-rent Path A repoint, the
NationalFinancialParameters publication, the monetary anchor, the four
new bound oppositions surplus_distribution/debt_spiral/credit/financial,
and the interest-burden/debt-accumulation correction terms).

Gates: mise run qa:regression 5/5 vs the new baselines; mise run
qa:e2e-regression ${E2E_CLAUSE}; two-independent-
process determinism proof re-verified post-regeneration
(tests/unit/tools/test_regression_construction_cadence_determinism.py).

```
Do not use `mise run commit --` for this specific commit — its re-staging sweep is documented to interfere with a deliberately partial/curated staging set (`ai/decisions/` note on `mise run commit` restaging gotcha); this ceremony commit's file list must be exact, so stage and commit with plain `git add`/`git commit` as shown.

- [ ] **Step 8: Record the ceremony commit hash in the report (separate, follow-up commit)**
```bash
CEREMONY_HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
```
Edit `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md`'s final section (`git commit --amend` is not viable here — the ceremony commit's file list must stay exact — so the hash is recorded in this dedicated follow-up commit instead):
```markdown
## Post-approval regeneration record

Baselines regenerated in commit `$CEREMONY_HASH` (substitute the real value).
`mise run qa:regression`: 5 passed, 0 failed (green against the new
baselines). `mise run qa:e2e-regression`: `${E2E_CLAUSE}` (already computed
in Step 6b above — substitute its resolved value, not the literal token).
```
Then commit:
```bash
mise run commit -- "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(reports): record the vol3 baseline ceremony commit hash (U8.5)

### Task U8.6: ADR + index.yaml catalog entry + ai/state.yaml

**Files:**
- Create: `ai/decisions/ADR083_vol3_money_scissors.yaml` (verified free; still run the `ls`/`grep` check in Step 1 and trust its output over this literal)
- Modify: `ai/decisions/index.yaml:6-7` (insert new entry as the first item under `decisions:`, before `ADR081_declarative_system_ordering:`)
- Modify: `ai/state.yaml:5-7` (bump `meta.version`, `meta.updated`, and prepend a new paragraph to `truth_status` immediately after the `truth_status: |` line, before the existing 2026-07-17 paragraph)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the ceremony commit hash from U8.5 Step 7; the approval record from U8.4; the filled `reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md` from U8.3.
- Produces: the permanent governance record for this work — nothing downstream in this plan depends on it, but it is the acceptance-criteria closer for U8 ("ADR landed; `ai/state.yaml` updated").

- [ ] **Step 1: Determine the real next ADR number — do not assume ADR083**
```bash
ls ai/decisions/ | grep -oE 'ADR[0-9]+' | sort -t R -k2 -n | tail -1
```
U7.10 lands `ADR082_sentinel_error_classes.yaml` before this task runs, so the next free number is `ADR083` — but other work may have landed since, so trust the command's output, not this note. The rest of this task uses `ADR083` as a placeholder; substitute the real number everywhere (filename, the `index.yaml` key, and the top-level YAML key inside the ADR file itself, which must match the filename per every existing ADR's convention).

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing test**
```python
"""Structural gate: every ADR file's declared top-level key matches its
filename, and every ADR file has a corresponding index.yaml catalog entry.
Mirrors the existing repo convention (every file under ai/decisions/ pairs
one YAML top-level key == filename stem, catalogued in index.yaml's
`decisions:` map) -- this test targets specifically the new ADR this task
adds, so it fails until the file exists and both edits are made.

  context: |
    Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-vol3-money-scissors-design.md.
    spec-024-capital-volume-iii was built but disconnected: create_financial_
    services() and the tensor_registry it needs only reached the live engine
    through engine/simulation/_legacy.py's calculator_overrides conduit, not
    through web/game/engine_bridge.py (the playable game, national-only) nor
    tools/regression_test.py (the qa:regression gate, fully dark). Two
    independent "fictitious capital" concepts existed with no coupling
    between them (FictitiousCapitalStock, FRED-grounded, dead after one
    boolean; fictitious_log, the synthetic oscillator with all the teeth).
    Four dialectic coupling edges (surplus_distribution->debt_spiral,
    credit->financial, plus price_value<->financial derived against
    coupling.py's operational definitions) sat reserved-but-unbound for
    months, logged at INFO and never surfaced.
  decision: |
    U1: wired create_financial_services()+tensor_registry through
    calculator_overrides in both the headless runner and the web bridge;
    built a committed deterministic FRED fixture
    (tests/fixtures/vol3_fred_series.json, 10 series) so qa:regression can
    inject the same overrides hermetically (no DB, no babylon-data drive);
    repointed graph_bridge.py's tick_ground_rent stamp from the always-None
    DefaultRentCalculator path to DefaultDistributionCalculator's real
    FRED-backed figure.
    U2: honesty sweep -- killed inline coefficients (DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD,
    DISTRIBUTION_EPSILON, COUNTER_TENDENCY_WEIGHTS,
    IMPERIAL_RENT_REFERENCE_SCALE, STAGNATION_CREDIT_GROWTH's bare-
    GameDefines() import bug) into GameDefines fields; fixed the
    ge=2007/le=2040 ValidationError (reached at tick ~1612 of 5200 on the
    already-live MELT path) to degrade to NoDataSentinel past the horizon.
    U3: NationalFinancialParameters instantiated in
    _compute_national_financial_state, published via graph_bridge under
    NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR = "national_financial", readable by
    CONSEQUENCE-phase Systems the same tick it's computed.
    U4: domain/economics/monetary/anchor.py -- fictitious_anchor (log-space
    pull toward FictitiousCapitalStock.ratio_to_real) and
    serviceability_anchor (real interest burden i/s), both
    NoDataSentinel-honest, pure, RNG-free; scissors dynamics unchanged when
    absent (the ~85%-of-campaign default state).
    U5: four new oppositions bound in build_default_registry (catalog 6->10,
    all antagonistic=False -- intra-capital conflict, not the
    capital_labor/imperial class-rupture pair); GraphInputs gains
    rentier_share/debt_ratio/credit_fragility/financialization_index;
    CouplingGraph activated as ServiceContainer's first production
    consumer, constraining ContradictionSystem's principal-contradiction
    ranking so a transforms target cannot rank principal while its source
    reads absent.
    U6: MarketScissorsSystem's calculate_serviceable_divergence gains an
    interest-burden term (MarketDefines.correction_interest_slope);
    correction severity gains an accumulated-debt term
    (correction_debt_slope); the fictitious oscillator is pulled toward
    the anchor by MarketDefines.anchor_pull when present.
    U7: five sentinel packages/extensions -- sentinels/liveness/
    (correct-but-inert), sentinels/aggregation/ (intensive-aggregation,
    fixing _mean_profit_rate's unweighted-mean variance error),
    sentinels/coupling/ (undeclared-coupling, verifying every declared
    CouplingGraph edge against a real measurement dependency in both
    directions), and gate-blindness extending the existing
    sentinels/coverage/ package.
    U8: empirical two-independent-process determinism proof (ADR056
    precedent) of the per-tick ServiceContainer.create(**overrides)
    cadence now carrying the Vol III calculator_overrides;
    reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md's per-scenario mechanism-named delta
    analysis; owner approval recorded; all 5 qa:regression baselines (plus
    qa:e2e-regression if it drifted) regenerated in a dedicated ceremony
    commit `<FILL: the U8.5 Step 7 commit hash>`.
  consequences: |
    Dialectic catalog grows 6 -> 10 bound oppositions; CouplingGraph gains
    its first production consumer (ContradictionSystem's principal ranking),
    so a `transforms` target can no longer rank principal while its source
    reads absent -- the ONE place this program alters existing semantics
    rather than filling absence. GameDefines gains a `capital_vol3` category
    (9 fields, including credit_fragility_scale) and three MarketDefines
    coefficients (anchor_pull, correction_interest_slope,
    correction_debt_slope); defines.yaml regenerated. NationalTickParameters
    loses its le=2040 ceiling (the fabricated-year bug); the Volume III
    structured layer degrades to NoDataSentinel past 2040 rather than
    raising. CreditState gains its first production constructor (U3.4) and
    DEBT_SPIRAL_THRESHOLD its first consumer (U5.10) -- both were dead on
    arrival before this program. All 5 qa:regression baselines regenerated
    in ceremony commit <SUBSTITUTE: U8.5 Step 7 hash>. Principal
    contradiction changed in <SUBSTITUTE: scenario list from
    reports/vol3-baseline-delta.md's per-scenario tables>.
    DEFERRED, explicitly: the three-way agricultural/resource/urban rent
    split (RentCategory stays DORMANT -- no data source); the Volumes I/II
    economics estate remains outside the qa:regression gate, narrowed with
    a reason in GATE_ESTATES rather than silently; no UI/lens work; no FRED
    acquisition beyond the ten committed series in
    tests/fixtures/vol3_fred_series.json.

Edit `ai/state.yaml`: change line 5 from `version: "2.38.0"  # ...` to `version: "2.39.0"  # ...` (append a comment noting this ADR if the existing comment convention warrants it), change line 6's `updated:` to today's date, and insert a new paragraph immediately after line 7 (`truth_status: |`), before the existing `(2026-07-17 overnight) THE EXECUTION SLATE...` paragraph:

    economics estate (spec-024) connected end-to-end for the first time --

    isolated tests. NationalFinancialParameters published to the graph
    (NATIONAL_FINANCIAL_ATTR); a monetary anchor (domain/economics/monetary/
    anchor.py) pulls the market-scissors oscillator toward real FRED ratios
    2010-2024, honestly absent thereafter (~85% of a campaign); dialectic
    catalog grows 6->10 oppositions (surplus_distribution, debt_spiral,
    credit, financial) with CouplingGraph activated as
    ContradictionSystem's first production consumer; a live year-2041
    ValidationError crash on the already-wired MELT path fixed
