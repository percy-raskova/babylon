# W10 Class-Surface Ternary Port — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Port the class-surface consciousness estate onto the ruled (r, l, f) ternary in the Rust engine — probability-lane ternary deffields with UNPOSITIONED-on-absence, the dominant-pole read path with the LIBERAL-first tie-break in one declared home, and the measured update law (agitation pipeline + routing law) re-pointed from the legacy cc/ni accumulator onto the ternary directly (issue #588; ADR204 W10's second half).

**Architecture:** New BSL content only — one new scenario, one new rule pack (a ten-rule byte-ordered chain `p0..p9` anchored under the already-registered `consciousness` system namespace), one Python reference implementation of the re-pointed law (the dual-implementation conformance oracle), one Rust conformance test, additive hash pins. No Rust source changes; no frozen-Python changes; no edits to any existing content file.

**Tech Stack:** Rust workspace (`rust/crates/{babylon-bsl,babylon-graph,babylon-tick}`), BSL content (grammar: `docs/reference/bsl.ebnf` + `docs/reference/bsl-language.rst`), cargo via `mise run rust:check`, Python 3.12 host venv for the reference generator.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-worldview-ternary-unification-design.md` (§4.2 measured ternary, §4.3 preserved laws, §4.5.2 port staging) — the plan argues from it; read it first.
**Archaeology digest:** `ai/scratch/2026-08-15-class-surface-port-archaeology.md` (verified file:line citations for every frozen site transcribed here; read it second).
**Issue:** #588. **Mint:** PR #586 / ADR206 (`WorldView` defenum landed).

## Global Constraints

Every task's requirements implicitly include this section.

- **Frozen Python is reference-only.** Every behavioral divergence from it earns a D-row in the register (`docs/reference/bsl-language.rst`; the tail was D145 at plan time — verify the next free numbers at execution) and a citation in the closing ADR. Port-as-is discipline (production precedent): transcribe exactly, D-record honestly, never silently repair.
- **Every pre-existing golden byte-identical at landing.** This train adds NEW files; the one modified Rust file is `tests/tick_goldens.rs` (additive pins). If any existing pin, golden, or vault page moves: STOP.
- **No new formalism (AE ii).** The ternary is the measured alignment; no stored gap-dynamic, no new node/edge kinds, no new verbs, no minted math. The Curve-5 Gaussian is NOT transcribed (ADR202 R7 — see Task 3).
- **UNPOSITIONED by law (L-ABS / ADR070).** Absence over fabrication: no 0.5 defaults, no hidden fallbacks. The port's absence idiom is `:optional` + `:default` with an explicit sum-guard — declared, content-visible, never a fabricated reading.
- **The ternary deffields are the FIRST `probability`-typed fields in committed content** (digest B.2). Pin that by name in the conformance test header.
- **Director-reserved content is not touched:** pole names, taxonomy membership, floor values, the five outcomes. Two flag questions ride the plan gate (below).
- **Branches from `dev`, in an isolated worktree** created via the superpowers:using-git-worktrees skill at execution time: `feature/w10-class-surface-port` (PR A, Tasks 1-2), then a fresh branch off the merged dev for PR B (Tasks 3-4). Conventional Commits with the `Co-Authored-By: Kimi Code <noreply@moonshot.ai>` trailer via `mise run commit`. Merges only via `mise run pr:merge`.
- **`mise run rust:check` green after every task.** Task 4 additionally runs `mise run check`, `mise run qa:regression`, and `mise run qa:vault-regression-ci` once, proving the frozen estate untouched. No baseline under `tests/baselines/**` may move; if one does, STOP — that is a §6.5 ceremony, not a side effect.
- **Token economy:** subagents write artifacts to files and return ≤15-line summaries. No subagent reads back its own full output.
- **Field naming:** node fields are node-type-segmented (`social-class/*` — subject-type derivation, production.bsl header item (a)); rule ids anchor under the `consciousness` system namespace; defconst namespaces are free-form (`consciousness/*`, the `economy/*` precedent). Reuse exact carrier qnames already declared in `two-classes.bscn` / `production-conformance.bscn` where the concept is the same (read both files first; the names below assume the reuse check).

## Director flags at the plan gate

**RULED 2026-08-15, both as recommended:** flag 1 — the seed is **(0, 1, 0)**, pure A-001. Flag 2 — **transcribe the linear chauvinist term** (R7's site = the Gaussian only). Execution: subagent-driven. The plan stands as written; the two D-row rosters cite these rulings.

Two judgment calls sat at the boundary of the reserved ledger:

1. **The class seed posture.** A class with material anchors (wages-paid + value-produced present) but no ternary record is positioned by `p0-position` at the seed **(0, 1, 0)** — A-001 (unorganized = liberal hegemonic default, spec 034) applied as the class-seeding law. The frozen bridge default (0, .5, .5) is the row-19 disease and dies by law; the community-model default (0.3, 0.6, 0.1) is floor content ruled for communities, never for classes. *Recommendation: (0, 1, 0) — `normalize_to_simplex`'s remainder-to-liberal branch already encodes the same default in the dynamics.* Floor values are reserved — confirm or overrule.
2. **The linear chauvinist pass-through.** ADR202 R7 retired the Gaussian at `sustained_exploitation.py:198` (the agitation *magnitude* component; replacement rides #491). The plan reads R7's "site" precisely — the Gaussian function only — and **transcribes** the separate linear term `chauvinist_pressure = max(0, balance) · chauvinist_pressure_scale` inside the routing law (pure arithmetic; the Emmanuel/MIM direction content, defines.yaml:228; ADR016 untouched). The wage-balance agitation *component* is absent (not zero-stubbed) pending #491. *Alternative reading: the entire wage-balance channel (linear term included) rides #491; the port stubs chauvinist pressure at 0.0c for now.* Confirm which reading holds.

### Task 1: Content declaration + the UNPOSITIONED idiom + `p0-position`

**Files:**
- Create: `rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/scenarios/consciousness-ternary-conformance.bscn`
- Create: `rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/rules/consciousness.bsl`
- Create: `rust/crates/babylon-tick/tests/consciousness_ternary_conformance.rs`
- Modify: `rust/crates/babylon-tick/tests/tick_goldens.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `WorldView` defenum (minted, `worldview-foundation.bscn`); the registered `consciousness` rule namespace (`babylon-tick/src/lib.rs:221-271`); the `:optional`/`:default` binding grammar (`bsl-language.rst` §3.5 — `:optional` is a flag requiring `:default <literal>`; both illegal on `:expr`).
- Produces: the deffield set every later task reads/writes (exact qnames below); the UNPOSITIONED idiom (optional `0.0p` bindings + sum-guard) every later rule follows; the spike verdicts recorded in the scenario header.

**The four spelling spikes.** Each has a named authority file and lands as a scenario-header comment. Fix spellings to the authority, never weaken an assertion.

1. **Probability-lane literals** — seed/`:default` form `0.0p` / `1.0p` (p/i/c unit-interval literals, ADR201's kind-blind widening). Fallback: `docs/reference/bsl.ebnf`'s literal production; record the lawful form.
2. **defenum sharing across scenario files** — try loading `worldview-foundation.bscn`'s declarations alongside the new scenario in one session. If the harness loads one scenario per session, re-declare `(defenum WorldView (REVOLUTIONARY LIBERAL FASCIST))` in the new scenario and add an ordinal-parity test mirroring `worldview_member_order_is_the_ruled_ordinal` (`tick_goldens.rs:281-293`).
3. **Edge declaration + edge-attribute deffield syntax** — authority: `content/scenarios/organization-foundation.bscn` (dyadic edges) and `content/scenarios/edge-write-lane-e2e.bscn` + `rust/crates/babylon-tick/tests/edge_write_lane_e2e.rs` (edge-attribute deffield rows, ADR203; the `<edge-type-lower>/<field>` naming, the `:strength` literal form). Needed for the WAGES `value-flow` attribute and the SOLIDARITY `:strength` literals.
4. **Float-expr → int-field write coercion** — production.bsl writes float exprs into int fields (`(add output)` into `social-class/wealth`); pin the rounding law (expected: truncation toward zero, mirrored by Python `int()`). The Task-3 conformance test proves it byte-exactly; if the store rounds differently, correct the generator's mirror and record the law in the rounding D-row.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing posture test**

Create `rust/crates/babylon-tick/tests/consciousness_ternary_conformance.rs` (harness imports mirror `territory_conformance.rs`; node-field reads use the same store API that file asserts with; absence assertions expect the store's absent-read error — digest B.2's "unwritten field errors on read (III.11)"):

```rust
//! Consciousness class-surface ternary port (issue #588, ADR204 W10).
//! FIRST consumer of the `probability` deffield lane in committed content
//! (digest B.2) — pinned by name here. UNPOSITIONED idiom: ternary fields
//! are never defaulted into existence; readers optional-bind with `0.0p`
//! defaults and gate on `(> (+ r (+ l f)) 0)` — a sum of zero IS "no
//! reading" (L-ABS), never a fabricated share.

#[test]
fn unpositioned_class_gets_no_reading() {
    // Load consciousness-ternary-conformance.bscn + consciousness.bsl; advance 1 tick.
    // class-unpositioned (no anchors, no ternary seed):
    //   - read of social-class/revolutionary errors (absent)
    //   - read of social-class/dominant-worldview errors (absent)
    // class-emergent (anchors, no ternary seed): p0 positioned it at
    //   (0.0, 1.0, 0.0) exactly; dominant == WorldView::LIBERAL member.
    // class-exploited (seeded (0.5, 0.4, 0.1)): p0 did NOT touch it.
    // employer (active, population, NO anchors): p0 did NOT position it.
}
```

Add the additive pin skeleton to `tests/tick_goldens.rs` mirroring the mint's pin (`:252-272`): `consciousness_ternary_foundation_hashes_are_pinned` — measure-and-pin in Step 4.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p babylon-tick --test consciousness_ternary_conformance`
Expected: FAIL — the scenario/rule files do not exist yet (loader error).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the scenario + pack skeleton**

`consciousness-ternary-conformance.bscn` — header records the four spike verdicts + the first-probability-consumer note + the reuse-check note (which carrier qnames came from `two-classes.bscn` verbatim). Declarations:

```lisp

```

Seed world (small ints by design — increments stay order-1 so the exact-f64 anchors are hand-checkable):

```lisp
; class-exploited — positioned, anchored, wage cut this tick, one org
; SOLIDARITY edge (strength 0.4p): the revolutionary-routing vector.
(node class-exploited NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS
  (social-class/population 1000) (social-class/active 1)
  (social-class/wealth 50) (social-class/wages-paid 9) (social-class/value-produced 10)
  (social-class/revolutionary 0.5p) (social-class/liberal 0.4p) (social-class/fascist 0.1p)
  (social-class/agitation 100000)              ; 0.1 in micros
  (social-class/previous-wages 10)             ; cut: 10 -> 9 (edge below carries 9)
  (social-class/previous-wealth 50))

; class-bribed — positioned, positive balance (12/10 -> +0.0909…), NO
; solidarity: the ADR016 fascist-routing vector; wealth declines 95 -> 90
; (the rent component). Also its outgoing SOLIDARITY 0.9p to class-emergent
; is gate-BLOCKED (its r = 0.1 <= 0.3): the percolation fail arm.
(node class-bribed NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS

  (social-class/agitation 200000)              ; 0.2
  (social-class/previous-wages 12)             ; flat
  (social-class/previous-wealth 95))

; class-unpositioned — NO anchors, NO ternary: the UNPOSITIONED witness.
(node class-unpositioned NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS
  (social-class/population 500) (social-class/active 1))

; class-emergent — anchors, NO ternary: p0 positions it at (0,1,0) this tick,
; then the whole pipeline runs on it same-tick (D116). Wage cut 9 -> 8 keeps
; its agitation live so the solidarity push lands on a routing class.
(node class-emergent NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS
  (social-class/population 600) (social-class/active 1)
  (social-class/wealth 30) (social-class/wages-paid 8) (social-class/value-produced 10)

; employer — active, NO anchors: the WAGES/SOLIDARITY source that must never
; be positioned (p0 guard) nor routed (sum-guard).
(node employer NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS
  (social-class/population 50) (social-class/active 1))

; org-solid — the org solidarity source (active latch convention).
(node org-solid NodeType/ORGANIZATION (organization/active 1))
```

Edges (spike-3 syntax): `WAGES` employer→class-exploited (value-flow 9), employer→class-bribed (12), employer→class-emergent (8); `SOLIDARITY` org-solid→class-exploited (`:strength 0.4p`), class-exploited→class-emergent (`0.5p`), class-bribed→class-emergent (`0.9p`, gate-blocked).

`consciousness.bsl` — pack header (D-record enumeration, the D116 byte-order map, the UNPOSITIONED idiom statement, the production.bsl-header shape as the model) plus the first rule:

```lisp
(rule consciousness/p0-position
  :material-basis "A-001 as the class-seeding law (Director flag 1): a class with material anchors (wages-paid + value-produced present) and no ternary record is positioned at the ruled unorganized rest state (0, 1, 0) — liberal hegemonic default, spec 034 A-001, THE one home (the seven scattered frozen sites are named in docs/concepts/consciousness-taxonomy.rst, not re-homed here).

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, fix spellings per the spike authorities, pin**

Run the test; fix load errors by consulting the spike authority files (never by weakening assertions). When green: measure the scenario's before/after hashes and fill the additive pin in `tick_goldens.rs`; assert p0 fired exactly once (class-emergent). Add the ordinal-parity test if spike 2 landed on re-declaration.

- [ ] **Step 5: Gate + commit**

`mise run rust:check` green. Commit: `feat(tick): declare the consciousness ternary surface + p0-position (W10 port, #588)` with trailer; body records the spike verdicts.

### Task 2: The read path — `p9-dominant-worldview` (one-home A-001 tie-break)

**Files:**
- Modify: `rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/rules/consciousness.bsl`
- Modify: `rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/scenarios/consciousness-ternary-conformance.bscn` (additive: tie-vector classes)
- Modify: `rust/crates/babylon-tick/tests/consciousness_ternary_conformance.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1's deffields + idiom; the frozen tie-break transcribed from `models/entities/consciousness.py:177-192` (verbatim below).
- Produces: `social-class/dominant-worldview` written per positioned class per tick (hash-neutral repeat writes, the D127 idiom); THE declared home of the hegemonic tie-break (taxonomy doc cross-ref lands in Task 4).

The frozen law (digest A.2, transcription source): `max_val = max(r, l, f)`; then in the order LIBERAL → REVOLUTIONARY → FASCIST, the first component within `1e-6` of `max_val` wins. The rule id sorts last (`p9-`) so once Task 3 lands, the readout reflects the same tick's update (D116) — matching the frozen step's post-update read.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tie-break vectors**

Add to the scenario (read-path fixtures: ternary + `agitation 0` seeded, NO anchors and NO edges, so Task 3's rules never touch them — p0 skips (ternary present), p5-p8 skip (anchors absent), p9 reads):

| node | seed (r, l, f) | expected dominant |
|---|---|---|
| tv-liberal-clear | (0.2, 0.5, 0.3) | LIBERAL |
| tv-revolutionary-clear | (0.6, 0.4, 0.0) | REVOLUTIONARY |
| tv-fascist-clear | (0.2, 0.3, 0.5) | FASCIST |
| tv-tie-lr | (0.5, 0.5, 0.0) | LIBERAL |
| tv-tie-rf | (0.5, 0.0, 0.5) | REVOLUTIONARY |
| tv-tie-lf | (0.0, 0.5, 0.5) | LIBERAL |
| tv-tie-all | (0.333333p, 0.333333p, 0.333334p) | LIBERAL |

Each also seeds `(social-class/population N)` (any N) — subject-derivation fields must exist — and NOT `social-class/active`… wait: p9's guard reads `active`; give every tv class `(social-class/active 1)`. Then in the .rs test: assert each tv class's `dominant-worldview` reads back as the expected `WorldView` member (the `Value::Enum` read-back shape, digest B.2; mirror the OrgKind read-back pattern), and `class-unpositioned` still has no `dominant-worldview` after the tick.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify red** — `p9-dominant-worldview` does not exist; dominant reads error.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `p9-dominant-worldview`**

Append to `consciousness.bsl` (abs-via-if and clamp-via-if idioms follow production.bsl:180,261 — the expr language has no `abs`/`min`/`max` intrinsics):

```lisp
(rule consciousness/p9-dominant-worldview
  :material-basis "The measured readout: dominant pole = argmax with the ruled tie order LIBERAL > REVOLUTIONARY > FASCIST at 1e-6 (frozen: models/entities/consciousness.py:177-192, transcribed verbatim). ONE DECLARED HOME for the hegemonic tie-break — the frozen estate smeared it across five sites (digest A.5c); here it lives exactly once. UNPOSITIONED classes (sum 0) are skipped: no reading, ever."

    (binding r :field social-class/revolutionary :optional :default 0.0p)

    (binding winner :expr (if (< dl eps) WorldView/LIBERAL
                            (if (< dr eps) WorldView/REVOLUTIONARY

  (when (and (= active 1) (> (+ r (+ l f)) 0)))
  (effects
    (update-node self social-class/dominant-worldview (set winner))))
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify green**; re-measure additive pins (the tv classes' post-tick state now carries `dominant-worldview`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Gate + commit + PR A**

`mise run rust:check` green. Commit: `feat(tick): dominant-worldview read path — one-home A-001 tie-break (#588)`. Open PR A (`feat(tick): W10 class-surface port — content + read path`, body cites #588/ADR204 W10/this plan), wait CI green, harvest Copilot (every inline comment gets a fix or a `gh api .../comments/CID/replies` reply), merge via `mise run pr:merge -- <N>`.

- Consumes: Tasks 1-2's deffields, idiom, spike verdicts; the frozen transcription sources (exact lines below); the confirmed effect grammar — `for-each` + `guard` effect forms (`bsl-language.rst` §2.8), `edge-between` / `field-of` accessors (§2.10/§3.8), the `solidarity/strength` implicit field and the `<edge-type-lower>/<field>` edge-attribute names (`tests/edge_write_lane_e2e.rs:67-91`).
- Produces: the ten-rule pack complete; the Python reference generator; exact-f64 conformance; the D-row roster (D146+; verify next free) for Task 4's register landing.

**Branch:** PR A merged — open `feature/w10-class-surface-port-b` from the updated `dev` in the same worktree (per the using-git-worktrees skill). Every file Tasks 3-4 touches already exists on dev via PR A (the pack, the scenario, the test, `tick_goldens.rs`), so the fresh branch starts from the landed state directly.

**Frozen transcription sources** (verified by the digest; re-read at execution before transcribing):
- `src/babylon/engine/systems/ideology.py:115-442` — the step: input reads (:236-317), the agitation call (:372-380), the routing call (:394-400), the popular-front throttle (:409), the accumulator clamps (:410-411), the decay (:413-414), the writes (:418-438).
- `src/babylon/formulas/consciousness_routing.py:48-200` — `compute_agitation_delta`; `:288-370` — `route_agitation_to_ternary`; `:373-409` — `normalize_to_simplex`; `:41` — `_EPSILON = 1e-10`.
- `src/babylon/formulas/contradiction.py:67-85+` — `calculate_wealth_asymmetry_balance`: `(W_b − W_a)/(W_a + W_b)` clamped to [−1, 1], zero-guard below 1e-9 → 0.0. Called as `(v_produced, w_paid)` — positive = wages dominate = the imperial bribe.

**The re-point (the headliner D-row):** the frozen engine accumulates `cc' = min(1, cc+Δr)`, `ni' = min(1, ni+Δf)` and discards `_delta_l` at the class call-site (ideology.py:394,410-411); the ternary is bridged at read (`r = cc·(1−ni)` etc., aggregation.py:86-98). The port stores the ternary directly: `r += Δr`, `l += Δl` (APPLIED, not discarded), `f += Δf·(1−suppression)`, then closure via a verbatim `normalize_to_simplex` transcription. The bridge and the cc/ni estate are retired (W1/W11). The port therefore diverges from frozen trajectories BY CONSTRUCTION — the conformance oracle is the dual implementation (this task's .py generator), not frozen floats (ADR183: the frozen engine is a structure/ordering contract, not a byte oracle).

**Byte-order map (D116 reliance, documented in the pack header exactly like production.bsl's):**

| rule | subject | reads | writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| p0-position | SOCIAL_CLASS | active, anchors, ternary | r/l/f, agitation (seed) |
| p1-inbox-reset | SOCIAL_CLASS | ternary (sum-guard) | solidarity-inbox, wages-inbox ← 0 |

| p3-org-solidarity-push | ORGANIZATION | active; per-edge strength | targets' solidarity-inbox (add), strength > 0.01 gate |
| p4-class-solidarity-push | SOCIAL_CLASS | own r (optional); per-edge strength | targets' solidarity-inbox (add), r > 0.3 percolation gate |
| p5-wage-balance | SOCIAL_CLASS | wages-paid, value-produced (optional) | wage-balance (micros) |
| p6-agitation | SOCIAL_CLASS | inboxes, previous-*, repression-faced, ternary sum-guard, consts | agitation (undecayed) |
| p7-route | SOCIAL_CLASS | agitation, inbox, wage-balance, ternary, consts | r/l/f (routed + closure), agitation (decayed) |
| p8-persist-baselines | SOCIAL_CLASS | wages-inbox, wealth, anchors | previous-wages, previous-wealth |
| p9-dominant-worldview | SOCIAL_CLASS | ternary | dominant-worldview |

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the Python reference generator (the executable spec)**

Create `consciousness_ternary_conformance.py`. It mirrors the pack's binding order operation-for-operation — reassociation is a conformance bug. Pure IEEE-754 basic ops only; no transcendentals exist anywhere in the re-pointed law (the Curve-5 Gaussian is retired, ADR202 R7). Core:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Reference implementation of the RE-POINTED class-surface consciousness law
(issue #588, ADR204 W10). NOT the frozen engine's behavior: the frozen engine
accumulates cc/ni and bridges to the ternary at read; the port accumulates the
ternary directly with simplex closure (D-row: re-pointed accumulator). This
script is the dual-implementation conformance oracle — it mirrors
consciousness.bsl's binding order term-for-term and prints repr floats for the
Rust test to pin exactly (pure basic ops; no libm transcendentals)."""

The scenario table in the generator encodes the seed world plus the edge sums (wages_in: exploited 9, bribed 12, emergent 8; solidarity_in: exploited 0.4, emergent 0.5 — the class-bribed→class-emergent 0.9 push is gate-blocked at source r = 0.1 ≤ 0.3) and prints every positioned class's `(r2, l2, f2, agitation_undecayed_micros, agitation_out, balance_micros, dominant)` as repr floats, plus the p0 seed result for class-emergent's tick-1 start.

**Hand-computed anchor table (direction checks for the reviewer; the exact repr floats come from the generator):**

| class | balance (micros) | increment | consumed | eff_sol | (r′, l′, f′) approx | agitation out (micros) | dominant |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| class-exploited | trunc(−1/19·1e6) = −52631 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.4 | (0.512, 0.37, 0.118) | 225000 | REVOLUTIONARY |
| class-bribed | trunc(2/22·1e6) = 90909 | 1.0 | 0.72 | 0.0 (chauvinist-clamped) | (0.1, 0.456, 0.444) | 1080000 | FASCIST |
| class-emergent | trunc(−2/18·1e6) = −111111 | 0.15 | 0.09 | 0.5 | (0.009, 0.982, 0.009) | 135000 | LIBERAL |
| class-unpositioned | — (absent) | — | — | — | absent | absent | absent |
| employer | — (absent) | — | — | — | absent | absent | absent |

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the generator; verify against the anchor table by hand**

Run: `uv run python rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/scenarios/consciousness_ternary_conformance.py`
Expected: printed repr floats whose decimal values match the anchor table's approximations (sign of balance, gate pass/fail, dominant pole, sum-to-1 within 1e-9). Any mismatch: the generator is wrong (fix it against the frozen citations) — never adjust the anchors to fit code.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the failing conformance test**

Add to `consciousness_ternary_conformance.rs`: one tick; assert every positioned class's seven outputs against the generator's repr floats EXACTLY (no tolerance — the estate norm, `lifecycle_conformance.rs` header); assert `class-unpositioned` and `employer` carry none of the seven fields; assert `class-emergent`'s wages-inbox is 0 post-tick (p1 reset ran after the push — byte-order proof) and its solidarity-inbox is 500000 micros (the class-bribed 0.9 push did NOT leak — percolation-gate proof). Additive pins in `tick_goldens.rs`.

Expected red: rules p1–p8 do not exist; only p0/p9 fire.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement `p1..p8` in `consciousness.bsl`**

Note the `0.0c`/`(- 0 0c)`/`(- 1 0c)` float-literal idioms follow production.bsl exactly; if the typechecker wants a different lane suffix in any position, fix to the authority (`bsl.ebnf` literal production) and record it in the header.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run to verify green; pin**

Run the conformance test. Discrepancy triage order: (1) the .py generator mirrors a binding wrongly (fix the generator); (2) a rule's expr tree associates differently than the generator (fix the rule — the BSL side is the transcription of record); (3) the store's float→int coercion law differs from `int()` truncation (fix the generator's `to_micros` mirror and record the true law in the rounding D-row). Never "adjust" expecteds. When green: measure-and-add the additive pins in `tick_goldens.rs` (post-tick hashes for the update scenario now that all ten rules fire; expected `fired` counts on this content — p0:1 (class-emergent), p1:10 (every positioned class), p2:12 (all classes are active; for-each no-ops where no outgoing WAGES), p3:1 (org-solid), p4:5 (sources with r > 0.3: class-exploited + tv-revolutionary-clear + tv-tie-lr + tv-tie-rf + tv-tie-all), p5:3, p6:3, p7:10 (positioned; tv classes read their seeded `agitation 0` and no-op), p8:3, p9:10 — verify against the harness's actual `fired` semantics, don't assume).

- [ ] **Step 6: Draft the D-row roster**

Draft (do not land — Task 4 lands) register rows D146+ in a scratch block at the bottom of the pack header first, then Task 4 moves them into `docs/reference/bsl-language.rst`:

1. **Re-pointed accumulator** — ternary stored and updated directly; Δl applied (frozen discards at ideology.py:394); closure via transcribed `normalize_to_simplex` replacing the per-axis `min(1,·)` clamps (ideology.py:410-411); cc/ni estate + bridge (aggregation.py:86-98) retired per W1/W11. Trajectories diverge from frozen by construction; oracle = dual implementation.
2. **Curve-5 Gaussian not transcribed** (ADR202 R7) — the wage-balance agitation component is absent; the magnitude-only E/P/S partition replacement rides #491. Linear chauvinist pass-through transcribed per Director flag 2 [amend per ruling].
3. **`wage_deterioration` stubbed 0.0c** — `opposition_states` graph attr has no BSL surface (ideology.py:153-157).
4. **`popular_front_suppression` stubbed 0.0c** — electoral register absent; exact under register-absent content (frozen's own :401-409 note: absent ⟹ 0.0 ⟹ bit-for-bit pre-U12 arithmetic).
5. **`material_conditions` buffer write not ported** (ideology.py:424-437: exploitation_visibility, reification_buffer, working_day_modifier) — no ported consumers; lands with its consumer systems' trains.
6. **Scaled-int lanes + write-coercion rounding law** — agitation/wage-balance/solidarity-inbox ride int micros; float-expr→int-field coercion law pinned by conformance [truncation toward zero, or the empirically corrected law from Step 5]; the .py reference mirrors it with `int()`.
7. **Solidarity/wages pull→push redesign** (D136-pattern) — exact vs the frozen sums (each edge pushed once by its unique source); per-(source,target)-pair multi-edge content narrows to per-neighbor summation (content discipline: one edge per pair).
8. **Class-source percolation re-point** — frozen gates on source `class_consciousness` (cc axis); the port gates on source `revolutionary` share — the same quantity post-W1.
9. **Seed posture (0,1,0) at first anchors** — A-001 as the class-seeding law [Director flag 1's ruling recorded here].
10. **UNPOSITIONED idiom** — optional `0.0p` bindings + sum-guard; no has-field combinator exists (digest gap 1); the idiom is the lawful §3.5 shape and is the row-19 disease's death certificate.

- [ ] **Step 7: Gate + commit**

`mise run rust:check` green. Commit: `feat(tick): measured update law — agitation pipeline + routing re-pointed at the ternary (#588)` with trailer; body carries the D-row roster summary + the anchor-table provenance.

### Task 4: Records, docs, issue hygiene, full gates, PR B

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/reference/bsl-language.rst` (land the D-row roster; renumber against the register tail at execution)
- Modify: `docs/concepts/consciousness-taxonomy.rst`
- Modify: `rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/rules/consciousness.bsl` (header's scratch D-row block becomes a pointer to the register)
- Create: `ai/decisions/ADR207_class_surface_ternary_port_handoff.yaml` (verify next free number)
- Modify: `ai/decisions/index.yaml`
- Modify: `ai/state.yaml`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Tasks 1-3's landed artifacts + D-row roster.
- Produces: the permanent records; the issue/board hygiene; PR B merged.

- [ ] **Step 1: Land the register rows** — move the roster from the pack header into `docs/reference/bsl-language.rst`'s register with full file:line evidence (the D116-D145 rows' format is the model); replace the pack-header block with the one-line-per-row pointer form production.bsl uses.

- [ ] **Step 2: The taxonomy doc page** — in `docs/concepts/consciousness-taxonomy.rst` (read it first; match its section style):
  1. **A-001's one home**: the `consciousness/p0-position` + `consciousness/p9-dominant-worldview` rules + the closure's remainder branch are THE declared homes of the hegemonic-default rule; name the seven frozen sites (digest A.5c: `formulas/consciousness.py:77-79`, `:83-91`; `models/entities/consciousness.py:177-192`, `:76-78`; `formulas/consciousness_routing.py:396-398`, `:405-407`; `projection/aggregation.py:69-73`, `:203-206`) as not-ported-by-law.
  2. **UNPOSITIONED (L-ABS) on the class surface**: absence has no reading; the idiom's mechanics in one paragraph; the row-19 death certificate (the ≥10 frozen 0.5-default sites, digest A.6, named).
  3. **The hegemonic-community semantic inversion** (spec §8 discharge): on SETTLER/PATRIARCHAL communities the `r` share reads as the conscious defense of the extraction position — same math, inverted reading (spec 034 spec.md:178's order, now documented). Record that the inversion has NO frozen code site (digest A.5d — doc-law only) and its Rust code home arrives with the community-carrier port (hyperedge attributes — chartered).
  4. **W12 note**: this train lands the READ couplings (the ternary is computed from the value-flow estate — WAGES/EXPLOITATION-adjacent fields, the balance, SOLIDARITY topology); the PULL couplings (measured shares modulating value flow) are chartered port-stage design work, no new formalism.

- [ ] **Step 3: ADR207 + index.yaml** — the handoff record: scope landed (content + read path + update law), the three corrections to #588's "preserved laws transcribed verbatim" framing (evidence: the digest): (a) the f→r ε-gate (`consciousness_routing.py:474-511`) has NO frozen production caller — porting it is greenfield, not transcription; chartered as its own micro-train (its proletarianization signal needs a definition from ported state); (b) "r→f capacity transfer" names a cluster, not a construct — the router's no-solidarity Δf branch landed here; the FascistFaction pull/capture chain charters behind the FACTION vocabulary (#589, Director-gated) + node-ref fields; StruggleSystem revanchism charters behind the Struggle port; (c) the semantic inversion is doc-law — discharged as docs here. Chartered follow-ons roster: W5 mass-work verbs (org-verb/OODA machinery absent), community-surface port (hyperedge attributes + queries + overlap formula — native Rust + AE(ii) escalation), the gap readout + Curve-5 partition (rides #491), the W7 seeding spec, W12 pull couplings.

- [ ] **Step 4: `ai/state.yaml` entry** — one entry, PR numbers, ADR number, D-rows landed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Full gates**

Run: `mise run rust:check` && `mise run check` && `mise run qa:regression` && `mise run qa:vault-regression-ci`
Expected: all green; every pre-existing golden/vault page byte-identical. Any drift: STOP.

- [ ] **Step 6: Issue hygiene + PR B**

Comment on #588 with the split verdict (title scope — read path + UNPOSITIONED + update law — landed; W5-verb surface chartered as follow-on with the machinery gap named; link ADR207 + the digest) and propose closing #588 with the follow-ons filed as new issues (the W5-verb surface; the ε-gate micro-train; the community-carrier port note riding the existing hyperedge-gap record). Post the row-19 discharge evidence pointer on #564 (the UNPOSITIONED idiom + the death-certificate doc section). Open PR B, CI green, Copilot harvest, `mise run pr:merge -- <N>`.

## Self-review notes (plan author)

- **Spec coverage:** §4.2 (measured ternary, UNPOSITIONED, shares-only, gap readout) — Tasks 1/3 land the first three; the gap readout's position-side carrier (E/P/S quantile sketch, #491) is not landed, so the gap readout is chartered (Task 4, ADR roster) — recorded, not silently dropped. §4.3 (preserved laws) — routing + A-001 + closure land; ε-gate and the inversion are corrected-staging (Task 4 ADR). §4.5.2 (staging) — read path first (PR A), updates after (PR B), frozen reference-only, D-records, no golden movement without ceremony. W12 — read couplings land; pull couplings chartered. §8 — the inversion doc page discharges in Task 4 Step 2.3.
- **Placeholder scan:** every BSL rule is written in full; the four spikes name their authority files and fallback ladders; defines values are pinned with line cites; the two genuinely runtime-known spellings (edge-deffield declaration form, probability literal suffix) carry spike steps with authorities.
- **Type consistency:** field qnames, const qnames, and rule ids are uniform across Tasks 1-4 (`social-class/*` fields, `consciousness/*` consts and rule anchors); the anchor table's values derive from the same seed table the scenario declares.
