# Babylon Core, Typed — a Haskell Algebra in the Lawverian Tradition

Draft 0 · 2026-07-22 · companion module `BabylonCoreDraft.hs` **typechecks under GHC 9.4.7** (`-Wall`, deps: base + containers only; remaining warnings are unexported-constructor residue, which is the boundary working as intended).

Scope per the prior feasibility discussion: this drafts the **functional core** — kernel, models, formulas, topology, dialectics — as one Haskell algebra, with the tick as the sole arrow. Persistence, the Django bridge, hydration/loaders, and intelligence stay in the Python shell. Nothing here is a spec; it is the type-level shape a spec would ratify. Every construct obeys the earn-its-keep rule (ADR051): it ships a law, a prediction, or a computation — never vocabulary.

The organizing claim: **most of the Constitution's Part I–III clauses are typing judgments that happen to be written in English.** The port's real payoff is not speed (though deleting the per-tick Pydantic round-trip will likely deliver some); it is that a class of constitutional violations stops being reviewable and becomes unrepresentable.

---

## 1. The two planes (I.7, I.12)

Constitution I.7: floats for quantities, enums for qualities, thresholds explicit, no continuous quality gradients. I.12: continuous control parameters, discrete state variables at fold crossings. That is a two-sorted ontology, and the type system enforces the sort discipline: the continuous plane is kernel newtypes with smart constructors, the discrete plane is closed sums, and the **only** morphisms from the first to the second are values of one type:

```haskell
data Fold q s = Fold
  { fThreshold :: q   -- explicit, Defines-sourced (I.7)
  , fBelow     :: s
  , fAbove     :: s }

crossFold :: Ord q => Fold q s -> q -> s
```

A `Fold` is I.12's fold catastrophe as a value. Its threshold is data constructed from `Defines` and nowhere else, so a numeric literal in a formula body has no type to hide behind — the magic-constants audit's Tier taxonomy becomes a construction rule rather than a sweep.

Kernel scalars are the existing constrained types, verbatim: `Probability`, `Intensity`, `Ideology` [-1,1], `Coefficient`, `Ratio` (0,∞), `Balance` [-1,1], and `Currency`. Smart constructors return `Either KernelViolation a` — refusal, not clamping; the only saturating arrow is `raiseIntensity`, and it is named, because consciousness saturating at 1 is a semantic, not an accident.

`Currency` is the deliberate departure: `newtype Micro = Micro Int64` fixed-point micro-units. Moving the value plane (the Φ circuit, wages, tribute) to fixed point makes cross-implementation byte-identity *trivial* exactly where Amendment Q's gap (2) bites hardest, at the cost of a one-time re-baseline that III.12(b) already anticipates. Ruling needed (§12).

## 2. Extensive and intensive quantity

This is Lawvere directly ("Categories of Space and Quantity," 1992), and ADR051 Phase D already shipped it operationally as `aggregate_extensive` vs `aggregate_intensive`: extensive quantities sum under aggregation (population, value, biocapacity); intensive quantities take share-weighted means (rates, tensions, consciousness — a gap is a ratio).

```haskell
newtype Extensive a = Extensive a
newtype Intensive a = Intensive a   -- NO Num instance, no sum arrow

sumExtensive      :: Num a => [Extensive a] -> Extensive a
meanIntensive     :: [(Share, Intensive Double)] -> Intensive Double
allocateExtensive :: [Share] -> Extensive Micro -> [Extensive Micro]
```

The type-level payoff is blunt: `Intensive` has no `Num` instance, so the classic bug class — summing tension ratios across counties — does not compile. `allocateExtensive` is the left adjoint of the scale adjunction (allocate ⊣ aggregate), integer-deterministic (floor per share, remainder to the first region *in insertion order*, so "first" has a III.7-defined meaning), and carries the sheaf law as an executable property: gluing = conservation.

```haskell
law_allocateConserves :: [Share] -> Extensive Micro -> Bool
```

## 3. The Lawverian layer, typed

Everything in this section already runs in Python under `src/babylon/dialectics/` (ADR051 A–E). Haskell adds two things: the laws become first-class `Bool`-valued functions lifted into the Amendment Q property layer, and adjunction defect becomes the **only constructor of tension** — tension cannot be invented, only measured, because `unitDefect` is the sole arrow producing it.

```haskell
data GaloisConnection p q = GaloisConnection
  { leftAdjoint :: p -> q, rightAdjoint :: q -> p }

law_adjunction :: (Ord p, Ord q) => GaloisConnection p q -> p -> q -> Bool
-- f x <= y  <=>  x <= g y

unitDefect :: (p -> p -> Intensity) -> GaloisConnection p q -> p -> Intensity
-- the gap: how far x <= g(f x) fails to close (Laclau; ADR051 "measured adjunction defect")
```

The adjoint cylinder is Lawvere's unity-and-identity-of-adjoint-opposites, L ⊣ U ⊣ R, with the shipped Phase B instance as its motivating inhabitant: over the SOLIDARITY subgraph, L = discrete (total atomization), R = codiscrete (total solidarity), U = underlying node set. The world's actual solidarity topology sits between two adjoint opposites, and atomization is its measured distance from R's image:

```haskell
data AdjointCylinder c d = AdjointCylinder
  { unity :: c -> d, leftOpposite :: d -> c, rightOpposite :: d -> c }
```

E1's two level lattices are chains with `aufhebung` as the least strictly-higher level where the resolution predicate (within-region variance zero) holds — `l < aufhebung resolved l` holds by construction rather than by test. E2's regime classifier transcribes verbatim as a total function, and RUPTURE stays what ADR051 made it: the crisis regime's boiling point, a `Fold` on the principal gap, not a separate mechanism.

```haskell
classifyRegime :: Epsilon -> Opposition -> Maybe Level -> Regime
-- Reproduction | Crisis | SublationTo Level

principal :: Defines -> [Opposition] -> Maybe Opposition
-- I.13: one leads per tick; rank = gap * (1 + rate_weight * |rate|)
```

The constitutional primitive lands with its fields named for the Compact, and "motion is primitive, statics are derived" becomes literal: a static is a fixed point of the Picard operator, and `staticOf` computes it.

```haskell
data Dialectic a = Dialectic
  { dThesis    :: Pole              -- A
  , dNegation  :: Pole              -- A-bar (determinate negation, not complement)
  , dWeight    :: Intensity         -- w — via unitDefect only
  , dMotion    :: Picard a          -- T
  , dSublation :: a -> Maybe Level  -- sigma
  }
```

VIII.9's n-ary protection is an absence: `Pole` includes `CommunityPole CommunityId`, and no exported arrow has type `CommunityId -> (Pole, Pole)`. Dyadic reduction isn't forbidden by review; it's unwritable.

## 4. The grammar: typing judgments

"Verb grammar" reads literally here. A well-formed edge is a well-typed sentence; the typing judgments — which subject and object kinds each verb admits — are GADT constructor signatures. I.14's "edges MUST be directed" is inherent: constructors have ordered signatures.

```haskell
data EdgeVerb v s t where
  Exploitation :: EdgeVerb 'ExploitationV 'SocialClassK 'SocialClassK
  Wages        :: EdgeVerb 'WagesV        'SocialClassK 'SocialClassK
  Tenancy      :: EdgeVerb 'TenancyV      'SocialClassK 'TerritoryK
  Adjacency    :: EdgeVerb 'AdjacencyV    'TerritoryK   'TerritoryK
  Membership   :: EdgeVerb 'MembershipV   'OrganizationK 'SocialClassK
  Attention    :: EdgeVerb 'AttentionV    'InstitutionK  'OrganizationK
  -- … full table in the module
```

| verb | subject ⊢ object | payload | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| EXPLOITATION | class ⊢ class | `FlowData` (Φ conduit, tension) | database-spec |
| SOLIDARITY | class ⊢ class | `BondData` (tension, resilience) | database-spec |
| WAGES | class ⊢ class | `FlowData` (super-wages from Φ) | database-spec |
| TRIBUTE | class ⊢ class **[confirm]** | `FlowData` | database-spec |
| TENANCY | class ⊢ territory | `TenancyData` | Sprint 3.5.1 |
| ADJACENCY | territory ⊢ territory | `()` — substrate carries no dynamics | Sprint 3.5.1 |
| MEMBERSHIP | org ⊢ class | `MembershipData` (tier: Sympathizer/Member/Cadre) | game-loop spec |
| PRESENCE | org ⊢ territory | `PresenceData` | game-loop spec |
| ORG_RELATION | org ⊢ org | `OrgRelationData` (mode, resilience, agreement, intel) | game-loop spec |
| ATTENTION_THREAD | institution ⊢ org | `AttentionData` (intensity, intel, phase, stickiness) | game-loop spec |

An ill-formed edge — ADJACENCY between classes, WAGES into a hex — is not invalid data caught by a Pydantic validator downstream; it fails to compile at the call site that tried to build it. Payloads are per-verb via a closed type family, so `edge.value_flow` on a SOLIDARITY edge is likewise unwritable. REPRESSION, COMPETITION, CLIENT_STATE from the database enum are omitted pending endpoint confirmation (§12) rather than guessed.

Node payloads follow the same pattern (`NodeData :: NodeKind -> Type`), with every value-plane field kernel-typed — a raw `Double` in a payload record is a review artifact.

## 5. Insertion order as structure (III.7)

ADR052 preserved NetworkX's iteration contract by wrapping rustworkx in insertion-ordered Python mirrors. Here the mirror *is* the structure — an insertion-ordered pure map, with per-source adjacency nesting so `edgesInOrder` reproduces source-insertion-then-adjacency byte-for-byte:

```haskell
data Topology = Topology
  { tNodes :: InsOrd AnyId SomeNode
  , tAdj   :: InsOrd AnyId (InsOrd AnyId SomeEdge) }

nodesInOrder :: Topology -> [SomeNode]
edgesInOrder :: Topology -> [SomeEdge]
law_insertionOrder :: [(Int, Char)] -> Bool   -- ports the nx differential oracle
```

Insert-on-existing-key updates payload and keeps position; delete drops the key (nx semantics, ADR052's pinned behaviors). The Hypothesis model test in `test_graph_iteration_order.py` ports directly as this structure's conformance property — the oracle survives the language.

This section is also where the migration's one real idiom shift lives, so it should be said plainly: ADR052's payload dicts are shared by reference and mutated in place by ~28 systems; these payloads are values and every system is `World -> World`. Reference semantics out, state threading in. That rewrite is the cost center of the whole program.

`addEdge` returns `Either Violation Topology`: well-*kinded* by construction (the GADT), well-*referenced* by check (dangling endpoints fail loud, ADR033). Two of ADR033's runtime invariants — dangling edges, negative currency — move into types entirely; `checkInvariants` keeps only the residue.

## 6. The mode category (I.15, ADR051 E3)

The modes form a presented category: objects are the five modes, generating morphisms are the ratified transition table, and `Path` is the free category on the presentation. Two constitutional facts become compiler facts.

```haskell
data Step a b where
  Degrade   :: Step 'Solidaristic 'Transactional
  Organize  :: Step 'Transactional 'Solidaristic   -- THE core player mechanic
  Marketize :: Step 'Transactional 'Extractive
  Formalize :: Step 'Extractive    'Transactional
  Rebel     :: Step 'Extractive    'Antagonistic
  ResolveS  :: Step 'Antagonistic  'Solidaristic
  -- … 17 generators total, transcribed 1:1 at ratification

organizingRoute :: Path 'Extractive 'Solidaristic
organizingRoute = Then Formalize (Then Organize Here)
```

First, I.15's prohibition — EXTRACTIVE → SOLIDARISTIC requires a TRANSACTIONAL intermediate — is an **absence**: no such generator exists, so no such one-step path can be written, ever, by anyone. Second, E3's corrected law ("no direct jump AND a transactional route exists") is an **inhabitant**: `organizingRoute` is the proof term, and deleting the intermediate makes the module stop compiling. E3 currently tests this; here the compiler audits it on every build. I.15's gates ("conditions reference contradiction internals") stay value-level guards on attempted steps — the type admits the step, the gate admits the occasion.

## 7. Formulas

All coefficients arrive through `Defines` (the GameDefines/defines.yaml image), which deliberately has no `Default` instance. The mathematical core transcribes with its theorems as return types:

```haskell
data Rent = RentFlows Currency | RentExhausted

imperialRent :: Currency -> Currency -> Rent
-- the Fundamental Theorem is the SHAPE of the type: while W_c > V_c the rent
-- flows and the core cannot rupture — not a comment on a float

sigmoidP13   :: Double -> Probability          -- portable, no libm (see below)
pSurvivalAcq :: Defines -> Currency -> Probability
pSurvivalReb :: Probability -> Probability -> Either KernelViolation Probability
rupture      :: Probability -> Probability -> Bool   -- P(S|R) > P(S|A)

routeAgitation :: Maybe SolidarityWitness -> BifurcationPole   -- Revolution | Fascism
deltaB     :: Defines -> Extensive Double -> Extensive Double -> Double  -- R − E·η
overshootO :: Extensive Double -> Extensive Double -> Either KernelViolation Ratio
```

`sigmoidP13` is the Amendment Q gap (2) closure point: a pure-arithmetic sigmoid (no libm), byte-stable across implementations. The body in the draft is a placeholder from the fast-sigmoid family; the ratified polynomial and its error bound belong to Program 13's float-honesty document, and the migration gate compares Python-vs-core under III.12(b) tolerances until cutover, then re-baselines.

`pSurvivalReb` refuses zero repression (`Left ZeroRepression`) rather than fabricating an infinity, and its saturation at 1 is named — Loud Failure applied to arithmetic.

The bifurcation shows the witness pattern that generalizes in §9: `SolidarityWitness` has an unexported constructor and `requireSolidarity` is its only mint, so the routing function cannot be called with a fabricated edge.

## 8. The tick: causality as types

Materialist-causality order is today a list in the engine plus review discipline. Here systems are phase-indexed, the registry has one slot per phase, and `advance` composes the phases in the only order that exists — registering a Consequences system into the MaterialBase slot is a type error. Base-determines-superstructure, compiler-checked.

```haskell
newtype System (p :: Phase) = System (Defines -> World -> (World, [Event]))

data Registry = Registry
  { materialBase :: [System 'MaterialBase]
  , oodaAction   :: [System 'OodaAction]
  , consequences :: [System 'Consequences] }

advance :: Defines -> Registry -> World -> Either Violation (World, TickReport)
```

`advance` is a function with no `IO` in its signature. Same `Defines`, same `World`: same result. III.7 stops being a discipline the regression gates check and becomes a property of the arrow's type — the gates remain as *redundant* verification, which is what Amendment Q says verification should be. The RNG is splittable pure state inside `World` with pinned seeds (ADR033); the tick hash consumes exactly the III.7 iteration surface (`nodesInOrder ++ edgesInOrder`), with the byte recipe owned by Program 13 (gap (1)). An invariant violation aborts the tick — `Left`, no partial states, no fabrication (III.11).

Within a phase, the list is the strict registry order — the 28 systems keep their sequence as data. Phase membership of all 28 needs transcription (§12).

## 9. Verbs as capabilities

Organizations are the agents (I.16); verbs operate through them (I.21). Each verb's Requires-clause from the game-loop spec becomes an argument whose type is an unforgeable witness — `requireMembership` is the only mint for `MembershipW`, so EDUCATE without a MEMBERSHIP edge is not a rejected action, it is an uncallable function. The spec's validation table becomes the module's arguments page:

```haskell
requireMembership :: NodeId 'OrganizationK -> NodeId 'SocialClassK -> Topology -> Maybe MembershipW
requirePresence   :: NodeId 'OrganizationK -> NodeId 'TerritoryK  -> Topology -> Maybe PresenceW

educate :: Defines -> MembershipW -> Double -> World -> (World, [Event])
```

The nine verbs — EDUCATE, AID, ATTACK, MOBILIZE, CAMPAIGN, MOVE, INVESTIGATE, REPRODUCE, NEGOTIATE — form a closed sum; `educate` is given a real body in the draft because it exhibits the state-threading idiom the whole port turns on (pure payload update and re-insert, replacing shared-dict mutation). MOBILIZE's consciousness threshold arrives as a `Fold` from `Defines`; OODA capacity (I.17) makes an unpayable verb unexecutable via `Maybe`, not exception. REPRODUCE is a `Tier` transition on the MEMBERSHIP payload — quantitative organizing work, qualitative membership change, I.7 again.

## 10. Boundaries as physics

Three module-boundary decisions carry constitutional clauses:

**Observation.** `World` exports no constructors; `observe :: World -> Chronicle` is the entire read surface for intelligence. "AI observes and narrates; the engine adjudicates" stops being a review rule and becomes linkage fact — the narrator cannot reach the math because there is no symbol to link against.

**Provenance (Aleksandrov).** State enters the world only as `Material (NodeData k)`, and `Material`'s constructor is exported only to the hydration module — the Ledger boundary. A formal construct with no material source has no way into the topology.

**Substrate immutability.** `HexState` and ADJACENCY payloads have no exported update arrows. The spatial substrate's immutability is an absence of functions, which is the strongest form a prohibition can take.

## 11. Law → verification mapping (Amendment Q)

| law (in the module) | pins | verification layer |
|---|---|---|
| `law_adjunction` | Galois connections are real adjunctions | QuickCheck property |
| `law_cylinderLeft/Right` | L ⊣ U ⊣ R | QuickCheck property |
| `law_insertionOrder` | III.7 iteration contract | property + nx differential oracle (ported) |
| `law_allocateConserves` | gluing = conservation (Phase D sheaf) | property + `conservation_check` column |
| `organizingRoute` | I.15 prohibition + E3 route existence | **the compiler** |
| absence of `CommunityId -> (Pole, Pole)` | VIII.9 n-ary protection | **the compiler** |
| `advance` purity | III.7 determinism | **the compiler** + goldens as redundancy |
| dense goldens, tick-hash chain | cross-implementation behavior | Program 13 artifacts, III.12(b) tolerances |

The pattern throughout: what the compiler can enforce, it enforces; the existing gates stay as the redundant layer Amendment Q requires rather than the only layer.

## 12. Open rulings

1. **Currency representation** — fixed-point `Micro` (drafted) vs Double-with-softfloat. Fixed point buys byte-identity on the value plane; costs a re-baseline. My recommendation: fixed point, and III.12(b) already licenses the re-baseline.
2. **Endpoint typing confirmations** — TRIBUTE (comprador→core as class⊢class?), and the omitted REPRESSION / COMPETITION / CLIENT_STATE verbs (institution⊢class? sovereign⊢sovereign?). Transcribe from `src/babylon/models`, don't ratify my `[confirm]` marks.
3. **The 17 generators** — the mode category's presentation must transcribe 1:1 from the repo's transition source; the draft carries the documented subset plus two marked speculative (`CoOpt`, `Break`).
4. **Sigmoid polynomial** — Program 13 owns the ratified coefficients and error bound; the draft body is a shape, not a spec.
5. **Phase membership** — assign each of the 28 systems to MaterialBase/OodaAction/Consequences; the draft pins only the composition order.
6. **Edge payload merge** — ADR052 pins nx attribute-merge on re-add; typed payloads want per-verb field-level merge functions or replace semantics. Draft uses replace.
7. **Where `EdgeMode` lives** — `OrgRelationData.orMode` (drafted, per the game-loop spec) vs mode as a property of more edge families.

## 13. What this buys, what it costs

Bought: determinism as a type rather than a discipline; the verb grammar and mode transitions as compile-time law; tension constructible only by measurement; intensive/extensive confusion unrepresentable; the intelligence boundary as linkage fact; and a formulas layer whose theorems are return types. The Lawverian layer turns out to be the *easiest* part of the port — ADR051's constructs are nearly literal Haskell already, which is evidence the 2026-04-26 discipline was load-bearing rather than aesthetic.

Cost, unchanged from the feasibility discussion: rewriting ~28 systems from shared-dict mutation to state threading (§5 is the idiom), a permanent two-toolchain estate for a solo dev, and the float cutover. Sequencing recommendation stands: Program 13 first (this draft depends on its artifacts at three named points), then a spec ratifying §12's rulings, then the port validated shadow-mode against dense goldens under III.12(b) tolerances.

Nix note from the prior discussion, for completeness: the toolchain (GHC 9.4+, cabal, HLS) lands in babylon-infra's existing flake devshell (ADR071 scoped Article X.1 to the production host); `packages.babylon-core` builds the core; the flake pin doubles as float-determinism infrastructure for CI. If the core binary ever deploys to the production host, ship the ELF, not a closure.
