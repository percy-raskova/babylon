Quickstart
==========

This guide will get you started with running a basic Babylon simulation.

Running the Simulation
----------------------

After installation, you can run a simulation with:

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry run python -m babylon

Understanding the Output
------------------------

The simulation produces several types of output:

1. **State Updates**: Changes to the world state each tick
2. **Events**: Significant occurrences (ruptures, solidarity shifts)
3. **Metrics**: Economic indicators and class relationships
