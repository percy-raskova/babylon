Installation
============

This guide covers how to install Babylon and set up your development environment.

Requirements
------------

- mise 2026.9.1 for the locked Python and uv toolchain
- ``rustup`` for the pinned Rust toolchain
- Debian window, audio, input and compiler libraries
- Docker Engine and ``docker compose`` for the default local Postgres database
- Git

Install the native Debian prerequisites first:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config git-lfs libssl-dev libpq-dev \
     libasound2-dev libudev-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libx11-dev \
     libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libvulkan-dev mesa-vulkan-drivers

Installation Steps
------------------

1. Clone the repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/percy-raskova/babylon.git
      cd babylon

2. Install the pinned Python tools and locked dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mise install --locked
      mise run install

3. Install pre-commit hooks:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mise run hooks

4. Verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mise run check

   Run the Rust check through the repository task:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mise run rust:check-no-docs

Open the Observer Game
----------------------

From the repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   mise run play

The launcher builds the runtime and Bevy client with native Cargo.
It reuses a reachable local database. It reopens a supported save from the
same campaign content version at its durable period.
On first use it creates a new campaign at period zero. Acknowledge the opening
warning, then watch or skip the production card to reach the Liberty start menu.
Choose **Continue** to enter the campaign the launcher prepared or reopened.
Each period advances four weeks in one simulation tick.

**New Game** starts the Wayne organizer campaign. **Observer Campaigns** offers
alternative scenarios. **Load Game** opens saved campaigns or compares the same
committed period using each campaign's saved parameters. **Settings** controls
audio, interface size, and reduced motion.

The start menu loops **The Purge**.
**Next in-game track** selects a recording for the campaign. The production card
has its own fanfare.

The supplied delayed-delivery parameters lengthen the ``sheet-transfer`` route.
The window observes the durable runtime.

The Michigan map has 83 county QCEW baselines. The production scenario
has five Designed county-industry cohorts, with 3D and compact 2D views.
The supplied horizon is 16 four-week periods (64 weeks); authored parameters can
select a shorter horizon. Observer campaigns have no player interventions.
**New Game** opens the Wayne organizer campaign.

To keep saved worlds and open a new campaign:

.. code-block:: bash

   mise run play -- --new
   mise run play -- --new --preset delayed

Edit ``content/scenarios/michigan/defines.toml`` before starting a new campaign,
or pass ``--defines /absolute/path/to/defines.toml`` to choose another file.
Each New request validates and saves its parameters. Open uses the campaign's
saved values even if the source file has changed or disappeared. See
:doc:`/reference/configuration` for supported parameters and units.

Older development saves with unsupported content versions cannot reopen.
Use ``mise run play -- --new`` to start a new campaign and keep those saves.

Use ``--campaign UUID`` to reopen a supported campaign, or ``--no-build`` after
building the current source. The default database is ``babylon_test`` on
``127.0.0.1:5433``. A custom ``BABYLON_RUNTIME_DSN`` must point to a
reachable local database. The launcher passes writer credentials only to the
runtime and read credentials to the window.

Development Tools
-----------------

The project uses several development tools:

- **Ruff**: Linting and formatting
- **MyPy**: Static type checking
- **Pytest**: Testing framework
- **Cargo**: Rust formatting, linting, and tests
- **Commitizen**: Conventional commit messages

Running Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run retained Python unit contracts
   mise run test:unit-ci

   # Run a specific operator contract
   mise run test:q -- tests/unit/tools/test_run_observer_session.py

Linting and Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   # Check and fix linting issues
   uv run ruff check . --fix

   # Format code
   uv run ruff format .

   # Type check
   uv run mypy src
