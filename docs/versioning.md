# Versioning — the save-compatibility contract

Owner-ratified 2026-07-20 (spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-versioning-rigor-design.md).
Commitizen enforces commit form; this doc defines what versions MEAN and how releases happen.

**Supersession note (2026-07-29, Amendment AE / ADR172):** v1.0 is redefined as the
**Rust engine's** release (Program 27 Refoundation), not the earlier Python "playable
archive" release; save-compat semver resets with it. The MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH policy and
ceremony below are unchanged in substance and apply to that release.

## The axis: player saves

- **MAJOR** — an existing save/campaign cannot load without migration. Examples: Ledger
  schema breaks, Archive embedding-column (`vector(N)`) binding changes, defines-format
  breaks that invalidate campaign state.
- **MINOR** — new features; old saves load clean.
- **PATCH** — fixes; no behavior-contract change.
- **Pre-1.0:** the strict reading applies anyway — a 0.x MINOR may not break saves.
  `1.0.0` is a promise-keeping event, not a semantics change.

## Commit scopes (controlled vocabulary)

`cli`, `intelligence`, `engine`, `persistence`, `render`, `web`, `data`, `deps`, `ci`,
`nix`, `flake`, `docs`, `plans`, `ai`, `specs`, `tooling`, `hygiene`, `packaging`.
babylon-infra additionally: `tf`, `ansible`, `cloudflare`, `secrets`, `tasks`.
New scopes are added here first, then used.

## The release ceremony (owner-run)

1. `mise run release:bump` — refuses on a dirty tree or off-`dev`; runs the
   releases-pin-environment check (below); shows `cz bump --dry-run`.
2. `mise run release:bump -- --yes` — the real bump commit + `vX.Y.Z` tag (local).
3. Owner pushes `dev`, then the tag. **Pushing the tag IS the release**: it fires
   `release.yml` (GitHub release) and `nix-release.yml` (signed closure → player cache).

## Releases pin their environment

Since the environment-sovereignty ruling (2026-07-21, ADR102) the toolchain is the
vendored flake: `flake.nix` + `flake.lock` live in this repo, so every tag pins the
environment by construction — there is no infra gitlink to police. What can still
drift is the lockstep, so `tools/check_release_pins.sh` (run by the ceremony and
re-checked in `release.yml`) asserts offline that (1) `flake.lock`'s `nixpkgs-data`
node matches the rev declared in `flake.nix` and (2) the builder's
`PINNED_SQLITE_VERSION` matches the `data-artifacts.yaml` product block. babylon-infra
releases version independently (`mise run release:bump` there) for its own ops surface.

## Tag namespace

`v*` is for releases, only. Historical/narrative tags live under `archive/`.
Owner-run cleanup 2026-07-20: `v1.0.0` (abandoned 2025-12 bump) deleted;
`v0.2.3-rent-trinity` and `v0.3.7.1-george-jackson-validated` moved to `archive/`.
