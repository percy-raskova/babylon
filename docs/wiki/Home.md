# Babylon Project Wiki

Welcome to the Babylon Project Wiki! This wiki serves as the central documentation hub for the Babylon project.

## Overview

**Babylon - The Fall of America** is a geopolitical simulation engine modeling the collapse of American hegemony through Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Third Worldist (MLM-TW) theory.

**Mantra**: *Graph + Math = History*

The project models class struggle as a deterministic output of material conditions within a compact topological phase space, using NetworkX graphs and Pydantic-validated state.

## Architecture: The Embedded Trinity

The simulation runs locally without external servers, using three pillars:

1. **The Ledger** (SQLite/Pydantic): Rigid material state (JSON entity collections)
2. **The Topology** (NetworkX): Fluid relational state (EXPLOITATION, SOLIDARITY edges)
3. **The Archive** (ChromaDB): Semantic history for AI narrative generation

## Key Features

- **Imperial Rent System**: Extraction via EXPLOITATION edges
- **Consciousness Drift**: George Jackson bifurcation model
- **Solidarity Transmission**: Network propagation via SOLIDARITY edges
- **Survival Calculus**: P(S|A), P(S|R) probability calculations
- **Territory Dynamics**: Heat, eviction, displacement routing
- **Topology Monitor**: Percolation theory for phase transition detection
