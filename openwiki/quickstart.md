# Quickstart — Babylon Wiki

> **Mantra:** **Graph + Math = History**
>
> Babylon is a deterministic geopolitical simulation engine modeling the collapse of American hegemony through **MLM-TW theory** (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Third Worldist) and a **Lawverian topological algebra**. The engine runs locally without external servers using the **Embedded Trinity** architecture: Ledger (PostgreSQL/SQLite), Topology (rustworkx/BabylonGraph), Archive (pgvector).

## How to Use This Wiki

This wiki is organized into **three namespaces** (per the Director's architecture directive, issue #335). **Never mix namespaces in one page.**

| Namespace | Purpose | Update Cadence | Audience |
|-----------|---------|----------------|----------|
| **[Glossary](/openwiki/glossary/)** | Stable concept definitions — dialectic `D=(A,Ā,w,T,σ)`, Imperial Rent Φ, Survival Calculus, hyperedge, fuel, ceremony… | Only when a ruling/ADR moves a definition | Both (definitions are the contract) |
| **[State](/openwiki/state/)** | What is true of the codebase **NOW** — architecture, systems order, gates, commands, data pipeline | Regenerated aggressively on merge to `dev` | **Agents primarily** (token-efficient context), humans secondarily |
| **[Flavor](/openwiki/flavor/)** | Narrative/theory exposition — cites the ruled ideological line | Only on Director rulings | **Humans primarily** (confidence-building, orientation) |

**Navigation rule:** Start here. Every major concept links to its canonical Glossary page. Current implementation state lives in State. Theory exposition lives in Flavor.

## Current Project Status (as of `786893fc` — 2026-07-29)

> **Source of truth:** [`ai/state.yaml:truth_status`](/ai/state.yaml), [`NORTH_STAR.md`](/NORTH_STAR.md), [`CONSTITUTION.md`](/CONSTITUTION.md) v3.0.0

| Epoch | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Epoch 1: Engine** | ✅ COMPLETE (25 systems, 70 EventTypes, 55 formula functions) |
| **Epoch 2: Foundation** | ⚡ IN PROGRESS — 3NF schema, census loaders, H3 geography complete; schema integration, LODES/freight, ideological cartography partial |
| **Epoch 3: Game** | ⚡ IN PROGRESS — 17 specs (011–066), Balkanization (070) shipped, 3.7/3.9/3.10 in flight |
| **Epoch 4: Platform** | 📋 VISION — DuckDB unification, Postgres 16 + pgvector (spec-037/ADR030) |

### Active Program: **Program 27 — Refoundation (Rust Kernel + BSL)**

- **Amendment AE ratified (v3.0.0, ADR172)**: Rust is the engine language; Python survives as data-build pipeline, out-of-process AI observer, and CLI periphery. Python engine freezes at `p27-python-freeze`.
- **BSL (Babylon Scripting Language)** is the **one additive formal construct** — expresses the closed algebra, mints no new mathematics.
- **Amendment D ruled NATIVE HYPEREDGE**: Hyperedges are first-class in `babylon-graph`'s exposed model; Levi/incidence is internal storage only.
- **Clause (xi)**: `ratty` + `Ratatui` are **required renderers** for in-game topology, hypergraph structures, and value-flow Sankey diagrams.
- **Theory ruling (same session)**: **No imposed functional forms** (sigmoids included). Curve shapes must **emerge** from P(revolution)/P(acquiescence) and the Lawverian algebra.
- **Phase 0 engineering complete** (16/16 tasks merged). Phase 1 blocked on: (1) `phi_hour` live regression fix, (2) RNG seed-threading gap, (3) v3.0.0 ratification merge.

### Active Remediation: **Loud Machine Program**

The July 7 playtest found the core loop broken; the holistic review found silent failures behind it. The **Loud Machine remediation** fixes everything found and wires the system so failures are loud instead of silent.

- **P0s resolved**: Schema parity crash, verb payloads rejected, verb targets were fixture IDs, tick-resolve datetime 500, map renders zero features, verbs were engine-side no-ops.
- **Gates live**: C.1 roundtrip, C.2(a) determinism A/B, C.3 migration idempotency, C.4 CI Postgres, C.5 Playwright, C.9 test-infra re-arm, C.13 resolving watchdog.
- **In flight**: Storage gates A/B/C, degradation envelope + stub visibility, nightly A/B, deptry, doc-ref linter, budget gates, wiring audit.

## Essential Commands (Human Onboarding)

```bash
# One-shot fresh-clone bootstrap: toolchain + deps + hooks + tuned Postgres 16 + schema
mise trust
mise run setup

# Verify install with self-contained smoke test
mise run sim:run

# Fast CI gate (lint + format + typecheck + unit tests)
mise run check

# Start the web game (Django :8000 + Vite :5173 as background daemons)
mise run web:dev

# Run the terminal game (Rust/Ratatui client — the ONLY client since M7 cutover)
babylon play
```

> **Requirements:** [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) (provisions Python 3.12 + uv) and Docker (for tuned Postgres 16 compose stack). New to the project? See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](/SETUP_GUIDE.md) for OS-by-OS walkthrough.
