# The Living Map — Design Bible

Program 16 / spec-113. Synthesized 2026-07-11 by Fable from the 21-agent Phase-R corpus
(10 UX books, 5 Paradox titles, Maxis + Paradox studio dives, babylon-data survey, 2 MIM
ideology reads, cockpit audit — full reports in this directory). This document governs
every design decision in the Living Map program; `specs/113-living-map/architecture.md`
governs structure. Where the two conflict, §9 here records the amendment.

---

## 1. North star

**The map is the argument.** Babylon's UI is not a dashboard reporting on a simulation;
it is a political map of a collapsing empire that the player reads, interrogates, and
acts on. Three research findings converge into one doctrine:

- Paradox: the map is the permanent full-viewport background; every panel is an overlay,
  never a room you leave the map to visit.
- Tufte/Norman: complex systems must push knowledge into the world — every number
  explains itself in place, spatially anchored to what it describes.
- Amin/Cope (via MIM): what the map SHOWS is itself the thesis — extraction, not
  "development"; colonial claims over an immutable land substrate; wages never shown
  without the rent that pays them.

Five pillars, each traceable to the corpus:

1. **Map never occluded, never left** (Shneiderman, Rules of Play's magic circle,
   Stellaris's full-screen-takeover anti-pattern). Chrome floats INSIDE the map's frame.
2. **Every number explains itself, by click-pin not hover-maze** (Vic3's #1 launch
   complaint; CK3/EU4's one-hover-then-pin ceiling; Norman's knowledge-in-the-world).
3. **One interaction grammar, one meaning per visual channel** (Norman consistency,
   Sylvester's channel discipline, Krug's neighbor test).
4. **Borders are claims, land is substrate** (Constitution + CK3 de-jure/de-facto +
   Amin: borders are colonial artifacts of the wage hierarchy — the starting map IS the
   colonial baseline, and its dissolution must be legible as exactly that).
5. **Voice rides on real numbers** (MIM's anti-formalism: cut any copy that performs
   tone without communicating an actual state change).

## 2. The map (cartographic substrate)

### 2.1 Layers (bottom → top)

| # | Layer | Source | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 0 | Land/water backdrop | Natural Earth v5.1.2 sqlite (110m/50m world frame; 10m US-adjacent context: coastline, lakes, major rivers) | muted, near-monochrome; the "table" the map sits on |
| 1 | County mesh (de jure substrate) | TIGER 2024 `tl_2024_us_county` → simplified TopoJSON keyed by GEOID (5-digit FIPS) | IMMUTABLE. Hairline county borders; state dissolve renders heavier "colonial" borders |
| 2 | Political claims (de facto) | polity membership from balkanization/sovereignty data → client-side `topojson.merge` over member counties | fills + thick claim borders; REDRAWS as counties change hands |
| 3 | Contest/mismatch | counties where de facto ≠ de jure | striped/hatched fill (CK3 convention), never a separate lens |
| 4 | Lens recolor | active lens fill function | recolors layers 1–2, never replaces geometry |
| 5 | Flows & markers | LODES commuter arcs, tribute/solidarity edges, org pins, event pins, AIANNH sovereignty overlay | full-saturation budget lives HERE only |
| 6 | Hex tiles (deep zoom) | H3 res-7 via existing member_h3 | visible only at deep zoom + as frontline shading inside contested counties |

### 2.2 Cartography rules

- **Geometry never animates; claims do.** County/state/hex boundary geometry never
  morphs (Debord agent + Constitution). A border "redraw" is a re-dissolve of polity
  fills along immutable county arcs, animated ≥600ms with a wire toast naming the cause
  (Rules of Play discernibility). CK3's drift idiom is the model: gradual claim
  transitions, instant snaps reserved for Rupture events.
- **Zoom tiers are registers, not magnification** (CK3): national = state-dominant
  political register; regional = county-dominant with polity fills; deep = hex tactical
  register with strictly MORE data per screen area than the tier above (Tufte
  micro/macro: zooming in must reveal, never merely enlarge).
- **Snap-zoom between tiers** (Stellaris), inertial pan/zoom inside a tier (Rules of
  Play's mechanical "play").
- **AK/HI/PR insets** — standard cartographic repositioning; naive bbox lets Alaska
  dominate (data survey). Territories (AS/GU/MP/VI) included in data, inset or listed.
- **Basemap**: self-authored minimal MapLibre style (land/water only, Cold Collapse
  values). The Carto Dark Matter dependency is removed — the political layer IS the map.
- **One cartographic frame across lenses**: lens switches change ONLY per-feature fill
  functions; camera, projection, geometry identical pre/post switch (Tufte's constant
  frame; testable byte-compare).
- **Pipeline**: TIGER shp → mapshaper (npx, verified available; no GDAL on this box) →
  TopoJSON with shared arcs; also consider `dim_county_geometry` (reference DB, full-res
  WKT — 46KB/county, must be simplified, never served raw). Target ≤ ~2 MB national.

## 3. Lenses

### 3.1 Taxonomy (fixed now, with headroom — EU4's 40-mode lesson)

Four groups, ~6–8 primary lenses visible as a flat bar, overflow behind one labeled
toggle (HOI4 cap; CK3 primary/overflow split). "Look" lenses and "act" targeting are
distinct systems (Vic3): verb targeting recolors eligibility on TOP of the active lens,
using one 5-state eligibility grammar everywhere.

| Group | Lens | Backing | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| **Extraction** | **Imperial Rent Φ** | economy metrics | **THE DEFAULT LENS.** Choropleth of net extraction, signed (drained ↔ enriched). A GDP-style default would reproduce the "backwardness" ideology the game refutes (Amin) |
| Extraction | Wage hierarchy W_c/V_c | metrics | class-stratification view, one toggle from Φ (Cope) |
| Extraction | Unequal exchange σ | trade-flows | edge overlay (color+thickness on tribute/wage flows), rides on Φ or wages |
| **Struggle** | Heat / tension | exists | single-hue ramp |
| Struggle | Solidarity network | communities/edges | lines-of-communication lens (Debord): full network drawn persistently while active |
| Struggle | Control ratio P(S\|R) vs P(S\|A) | metrics | rupture-proximity shading |
| **Political** | Claims (stance/faction/collapse) | balkanization | the de-facto polity view; striped mismatch built in |
| Political | National oppression | class composition + AIANNH | oppressed-nation territories vs settler-core (MIM lexicon: legend language) |
| **Reproduction** | Habitability / overshoot | exists | ecology NEVER a siloed green tab — paired with Φ (Amin's second dimension) |
| Reproduction | Dispossession | eviction/foreclosure (ref DB, future) | data-grounded expansion |

Future data-grounded lenses (survey): LODES commuter arcs, QCEW employment, coercive
infrastructure (repression icons grounding P(S|R)), Gini, broadband organizing-capacity,
FAF freight corridors. The taxonomy has slots for all of them.

### 3.2 Lens rules

- One lens = one dominant variable = one legend (HOI4/SimCity). No blended heatmaps.
- Quantitative ramps: single-hue light→dark within Cold Collapse; never >2 hues per
  variable; never rainbow (Tufte). Ramp DOMAIN fixed per session/lens — silent rescaling
  between ticks is banned; domain changes fire a legend flash (Tufte integrity).
- Full-saturation color is reserved for small discrete markers (event pins, selected
  units, active conflicts). Large polygon fills stay in Imhof's muted range (Tufte).
- Legend always visible while a non-default lens is active, adjacent to the map, swatches
  rendered against map-canvas tone (not panel white); legend shows a marker for where
  the current world state sits on the ramp (Sylvester).
- Every lens hotkey-bound; Q/E cycles (existing); number keys = speed (HOI4 gap).
- Colorblind-safe redundancy in every lens (shape/luminance/pattern, not hue alone) —
  HOI4/CK3/Stellaris all shipped without it and paid; QA against a simulator pre-ship.
- Selecting a lens syncs the relevant panel (Vic3: map and panel state never siloed).

## 4. Progressive disclosure — the InspectionStack

The recursive drill-down is the game's pedagogy: it teaches Cope/Amin through play.

- **Click-to-pin stacked cards, not hover chains.** Hover preview = one level max
  (EU4's ceiling); anything deeper is a click that pushes a breadcrumbed card (Krug:
  `>`-separated trail, current node bold). Vic3 paid a patch cycle to learn this.
- **Human-value labels first, coefficients on drill** (Sylvester): the top of a county
  card says "besieged / organized / bleeding value", not `k=0.73`.
- **Wages never naked** (Cope, binding): any wage figure renders in the same view as
  value produced and the imperial-rent transfer explaining the gap.
- **The rebuttal layer**: wherever a wage/productivity number appears, the apologist
  explanation ("skill premium") is one click from its refutation (Cope Part III) —
  this is the game's version of Tufte's full-population rule.
- **Every stat row shows its comparison baseline** (Tufte VE): distribution position,
  trend sparkline (with realized min/max labeled inline), or paired comparator.
- **Depth is content-limited, not technically infinite** (CK3); terminal frames are
  FormulaCards: expression, inputs (each recursively explainable), constants with
  provenance. Backed by the additive `/explain/` endpoint (architecture §2.4).
- **One fixed layout shell across all depth levels** (Tufte VDQI): country → region →
  county → hex reuse one card anatomy; only data changes.
- **Same-name discipline** (Krug): a drill-down card is titled with the EXACT term used
  in the parent row that opened it.
- **Read/write symmetry** (Paradox's most-cited Vic3 failure): any card stating a
  changeable fact links to the verb that changes it (ActionDock deep-link).
- Every StatChip in the TopBar is itself a Probe — disclosure starts at the top bar.

## 5. Chrome and the event system

### 5.1 Layout

- Four strata per architecture §0; every panel is a FloatingPanel INSIDE the map frame
  (magic circle). Content-to-chrome ratio ≥80% per panel (Tufte's kiosk test).
- TopBar: 4±1 clusters (Universal Principles), not a flat row: [identity/date/speed]
  [Φ chip + overshoot chip, paired, sharing color grammar] [alerts] [takeovers].
  Φ and O=C/B are the two permanent vitals (MIM theory agent).
- OutlinerOverlay: the always-on index of the player's organizations (Stellaris: the
  outliner is the real HUD); filterable, compact-density mode AT LAUNCH (Paradox lesson:
  list surfaces degrade with player success).
- ActionDock: ≤3 primary verbs at first contact + labeled "more" (Shneiderman
  progressive disclosure); verbs show live cost/eligibility on the button (EU4
  governing-capacity lesson); predicted delta arrows before commit (Sylvester); only
  currently-legal verbs rendered prominent (Universal Principles context sensitivity);
  bulk-apply escape hatch for multi-territory orders (Vic3 click-tax).
- Every overlay remembers its last-viewed subject per session (EU4 complaint).

### 5.2 Events: two streams, three channels, two lifetimes

- **Two streams** (Stellaris 2026 rework, designed-in from day one): URGENT/actionable
  vs AMBIENT/narrative. The wire feed is the ambient stream — a newspaper, not a log
  (SimCity: headlines with voice get read; toasts get tuned out).
- **Severity tiers** (Norman alarm-fatigue): ambient / notable / critical. Only critical
  interrupts. Multiple criticals in one tick merge into one queued surface, never
  stacked equal-weight alerts.
- **Critical events fire on three channels at once** (Sylvester): wire entry + toast +
  map-anchored visual on the affected geography.
- **Two toast lifetimes** (Stellaris): persistent-until-acted for decisions;
  ephemeral-with-generous-timing for flavor; simultaneous low-priority events batch into
  one expandable toast.
- **Recoverable dismissal tray** (HOI4): a missed toast is retrievable, not gone.
- **Per-category mute controls, in-context on each toast** (EU4 message settings), and
  a planned consolidation pass as event volume scales (Vic3 needed −50% post-launch;
  budget it now).
- **Positive-feedback loops get early map warnings** (Rules of Play/LeBlanc): solidarity
  snowballs and fascist consolidation show accelerating-trend glyphs before
  irreversibility.
- Autopause already exists; CriticalEventModal gives it its face (architecture §4.2),
  with a bounded default action so an ignored popup never stalls the game (CK3).

### 5.3 Interaction grammar (one, everywhere)

- Left-click = inspect (push card). Right-click = act (verb context at the clicked
  point). Drag = pan; scroll = zoom; Q/E = lens cycle; space = pause/resume; 1/2/3 =
  speed. This grammar NEVER varies by lens/zoom/panel (Norman standardization).
- Verbs with spatial targets are executable ON the map (Shneiderman direct
  manipulation); the dock form is the fallback for non-spatial verbs. Failed spatial
  actions snap back with a rejection animation, not a modal (Shneiderman).
- Legal-target highlighting: action-implying color appears ONLY on currently-legal
  targets for the selected org (Shneiderman/Rules of Play conveyance).
- Every interactive map element carries a signifier beyond its geometry (hover glow,
  cursor, halo); decorative elements never reuse that treatment (Norman/Krug).
- First paint of any lens/panel within 200ms; data may refine progressively after.

## 6. Visual language (Cold Collapse, evolved)

The audit found two visual languages coexisting: the takeovers' phosphor/scanline
diegetic voice vs the shell's neutral devtools micro-typography. **The reskin extends
the first into the second** — the game already knows how to look like itself.

- Palette: Cold Collapse ratified values untouched. Additions are ROLE tokens (chrome
  elevation, claim-border, contest-stripe, severity tiers) not new hues. Cyan
  ornamentation stays on frames/chrome, never over numbers or map fills (Vic3 trade-panel
  lesson). Red enters as the single structural urgency accent (MIM visual culture:
  red as rule/banner, not mood lighting).
- Grids/borders: hex outlines, gridlines, dividers at 20–30% the alpha of the data they
  host (Tufte); no solid-black boxed chrome outside critical modals; run the 1+1=3
  audit on every divider (Envisioning Information).
- Encodings: ≤2 visual encodings per datum; no pie charts anywhere (composition = ordered
  bars/BreakdownBar); no fake-3D, no texture fills in data surfaces (VDQI).
- Type: two registers matching the two voices — terse mono/numeric register for HUD and
  wire headlines; longer serifed/periodic register reserved for deep drill-down theory
  panes (MIM's newspaper vs theory registers). No ALL-CAPS shouting; urgency via
  weight/size/color (MIM pitfalls).
- Motion: 200ms response floor; 600ms+ for meaning-bearing transitions (border
  re-dissolves, endgame); every animated/tick-scrubbed view keeps a persistent tick/date
  readout (Tufte's dequantified-animation ban); a subtle tick pulse on the time control
  so advancement is never silent (Norman feedback).
- The un-slick principle (MIM visual culture): woodcut/newsprint sensibility over gloss.
  Icon-grid badges (one small glyph per cause/verb) over hero art. If illustrated events
  ever ship, they are agit-poster, credited, not stock.

## 7. Voice and lexicon

- **Two registers** (MIM): wire/HUD = newspaper (short declaratives, actor + action +
  tick by the second clause, scare-quoted state euphemisms); drill-down = theory
  (periodic sentences, enumerations, citations).
- **Copy rules** (binding, from mim/voice-and-lexicon.md): headlines lead with actor +
  action + date; name the driving contradiction explicitly; tone modulated to actual
  stakes; imperative second person ONLY for opted-in confirmations; endgames are never
  neutral scoreboard text; every stat is one click from its formula; one glossary fixes
  every recurring name's spelling everywhere.
- **Lexicon adopted**: labor aristocracy, superprofits/superexploitation (threshold
  badge, not slider), united front (alliance mechanic), mass line (educate/investigate
  loop), principal contradiction (HUD label), revisionism/opportunism (drift labels),
  cardinal principles (org founding), national oppression / oppressed vs settler nation
  (lens language), self-determination (late-game verb distinct from liberate), vanguard
  (top-tier org), comprador (peripheral ruling class).
- **Explicitly NOT adopted**: orthographic stunts ("Amerika", "$", "kkk") — achieve the
  same force through mechanics (territories renamed on liberation); real-world factional
  invective; the "gender aristocracy" frame (flagged weakest/essentialist); figure
  hagiography (channel into generated leaders instead).
- **Purge the admin voice**: every empty state ("No world state loaded yet.") rewritten
  in-register (the Wire already proves the codebase can do it — "neutrality is
  hegemony"). Component vocabulary de-IDE'd where player-facing.

## 8. Playability details

- Scenarios start paused (Vic3 community norm), on the Φ lens, camera framed to the
  scenario region with the world-context backdrop visible.
- Onboarding: no 67-box scripted tutorial (CK3 telemetry); per-coachmark dismissal
  (Stellaris); new mechanically-significant conventions (claim redraw, contested
  stripes, siege badges) must occur in a guaranteed low-stakes early context before
  they carry weight (Sylvester); instrument completion-vs-retention from day one.
- Under-explain verbs, let cheap legible failure teach (Wright's possibility space);
  the wire + InspectionStack are the query tool that makes failure legible.
- Trunk test (Krug) as a standing QA ritual: from any blurred mid-tick screenshot, a
  first-time viewer names faction, date, active lens, and the way back to the default
  map.
- Loud Failure (Constitution III.11) extends into the UI: stale/sentinel/fallback values
  render flagged, never as plausible color (SimCity 2013's sin, inverted).

## 9. Amendments to architecture.md (from research)

1. **Default lens is Imperial Rent Φ**, not political-topology (MIM theory agent;
   §3.2's lens roster reorders accordingly). Political claims remain the layer-2
   substrate under every lens.
2. **HexTooltip.tsx and FramingSelector.tsx ownership → Lane B** (audit found them
   unowned in §5). FramingSelector inverts per the Carto addendum: county/state are
   primary framings, hex is the deep-zoom register — default framing changes and its
   semantic weight flips.
3. **Lane E additions**: recoverable toast tray, per-category in-context mutes,
   two-lifetime toasts, urgent-vs-ambient stream split (all §5.2 here).
4. **Lane Carto additions**: AIANNH tribal-areas overlay (867 features, sovereignty
   lens material); AK/HI/PR insets; `dim_county_geometry`/`bridge_county_h3` noted as
   existing DB endpoints (simplification still required; res-8 discrepancy vs
   Constitution II.13 flagged to the Program 11 owner, not ours).
5. **Eligibility grammar**: one 5-state target-eligibility color grammar shared by all
   verbs/lenses (Vic3), owned by Lane B, consumed by Lane F's TargetPicker map mode.
6. **OrgSelect / faction `<select>` controls** (audit): restyled in-register in Phase D;
   map-native org picking queued as a follow-on, matching TargetPicker's pick-on-map.
7. **TimeseriesChart** stays hosting-only in Lane E but is flagged for a BblData-idiom
   restyle in Phase D (audit: last chart-first component).

## 10. Acceptance gates (Phase V additions)

- Lens-switch frame invariance (camera/geometry byte-identical pre/post).
- Ramp-domain stability across ticks (no silent rescale).
- Render-count stability for MapStage under chrome toggles (existing pattern).
- Border re-dissolve produces clean rings (vitest fixture: county set → ring count).
- Trunk test + neighbor test on the five core chrome surfaces.
- Colorblind simulator pass on every lens.
- Content-to-chrome ≥80% on TopBar/ActionDock/InspectionCard.
- Every wire headline names actor + action + tick (copy lint).
