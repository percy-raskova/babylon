# Epochs Vision Gap Audit

**Branch:** `feature/17-living-engine` · **Date:** 2026-07-14 · **Scope:** every item in `ai/epochs/` (4 epochs) and `ai/brainstorms/` (2 corpora) cross-joined against current code, via 12 verified evidence bundles (373 items) and 5 reality maps (engine, event pipeline, sentinel rails, frontend, data availability).

**Purpose:** the owner's standing claim is *"the vision in ai/epochs/ is fundamentally the vision of where I want this game to go, and I don't see a lot of that reflected in our game."* This report tests that claim against code, item by item, and turns the result into a working backlog. The epochs corpus is an **early incarnation** — file paths and class names in it are frequently stale — so every row below evaluates the *mechanic*, not the literal code the corpus describes.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Across the 373 catalogued vision items, hand-tallied from the 12 evidence bundles:

| Status | Count | Share | What it means here |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BUILT** | ~43 | ~12% | Live, reaches the player today, matches the vision's intent |
| **PARTIAL** | ~177 | ~47% | **The headline bucket.** Engine/data already computes the mechanic — it just never reaches the screen |
| **MISSING** | ~139 | ~37% | No engine code, no data, nothing to wire — real unstarted work |
| **SUPERSEDED** | ~14 | ~4% | A later, owner-ratified decision replaced the vision's specific mechanic with a different one that serves the same intent — do not rebuild the original |

**The honest headline:** the owner is right that little of the epochs *feel* is showing up in play, but wrong about why. Reading the code says the mechanics are mostly already there — PARTIAL outnumbers MISSING nearly 1.3:1. The George Jackson power-vacuum bifurcation, the Fascist Bifurcation routing, the Vanguard Resource Triad (Cadre/Sympathizer/Reputation labor), the Ideological Trap Detectors (Liberal/Ultra-Left/Rightist), the four-phase terminal crisis cascade, dispossession events, reserve-army wage pressure, the credit-cycle phase machine, the disproportionality-crisis detector — all of this is real, tested, tick-by-tick code. Almost none of it reaches a screen. The reasons repeat across dozens of unrelated items: an `EventType` gets emitted and silently dropped at a 34-of-79 whitelist boundary in the bridge; a graph attribute gets computed every tick and never registered in `SEAM_REGISTRY`; a serializer exists but has no typed TypeScript contract so nothing renders it; a dependency-injected calculator (counter-tendency, class-transition stationary distribution, the rule-based State AI) is constructed and then never called by any System. This is the exact "neglected seam" thesis the project's own 2026-07-12 consolidation report already named — this audit is the first attempt to size it against the full epochs corpus rather than against the current codebase's self-description.

**Where the true MISSING mass sits** (the 37% that is real, unstarted work, not a wiring problem): three programs absorb most of it. (1) **The entire Doctrine/Theoretical-Labor/ideological-DAG layer** (epoch3-player) — no doctrine node model, no TL resource, no branching trunks anywhere in the tree; this is the single largest coherent MISSING cluster. (2) **Repression-apparatus reachability** — Feature-039's State AI, Attention Threads, and Legal Frameworks are real, non-trivial code that has *never once executed in a real playthrough* because every entry point is gated on an org attribute (`faction_balance`) that no scenario ever sets; this reads as "missing" in play even though the code exists. (3) **Whole real-world data programs** that were never rebuilt after spec-037 deleted ~25 loaders in one commit (`4ce7c96a`) — 13 Census ACS demographic tables, FAF5 freight, HIFLD/MIRTA carceral-and-military geography are all schema-only, zero consumer, zero loader.

**What SUPERSEDED means here:** these are not gaps. They are cases where the owner (or a later spec) already made a *different, equally valid* concrete decision that serves the same thematic intent as the epochs item — e.g., the ratified "Installer"/ksbc palette instead of "Bunker Constructivism," the real per-county Leontief Φ map as the default lens instead of an abstract 4-node circuit diagram, `DecompositionSystem`'s live 30/70 class split instead of a scripted proletarianization event. Building the epochs' original version of these would be regressive, not additive — see §6.

---

## 2. The Vision Spine

The epochs corpus imagines the player as a **Synopticon decoder, not a god** — someone who reads a fractured multi-channel wire (corporate press vs. liberated signal vs. state intelligence) to understand a class war they can nudge but never command outright, acting *through* an Organization rather than as an omniscient hand. Underneath that reading experience sits a hard **tensor/value substrate** — MELT, imperial rent, the Leontief input-output lattice, Φ-per-labor-hour — so that every wage, every extraction, every eviction is traceable to a material relation, never a scripted event. **Doctrine and strategy** are meant to be a real axis of play: a branching ideological DAG (Reformist / Insurrectionist / Autonomist / Scientific-Leninist trunks), a cadre-vs-mass resource economy (Cadre Labor / Sympathizer Labor / Reputation / Theoretical Labor), and named strategic traps (Liberal capture, Ultra-Left isolation, Rightist passivity) that punish bad praxis as concretely as bad economics punishes bad policy. **Repression is meant to be a geography, not a stat** — carceral sinks (reservations, penal colonies, concentration camps), a state apparatus that spends a finite pool of "attention threads" on surveillance and must choose what to watch, and a **fog of class war** where intel about hostile territory is unreliable by design. **Metabolic and imperial circuits are twinned engines of the same collapse**: the Fundamental Theorem's Imperial Rent siphons periphery value into Core wages, while an independent ecological ledger (biocapacity, hysteresis, overshoot) can bankrupt the whole system even if the class war is "won" — the corpus's signature trap of winning the revolution while losing the planet (or vice versa, the Red Settler Trap). **Balkanization is the intended endgame architecture**: sovereignty as a claims-overlay on an immutable hex substrate, collapsing into several named, materially distinct terminal states rather than one win/lose binary. Above all, every one of these systems is meant to be legible through a **Gramscian wire** — a narrator that decodes propaganda into material meaning term-by-term — so the player's felt experience is "the mask is coming off," not "a stat went up."

## 3. Status Ledger

One sub-table per evidence bundle, grouped by epoch. **Every row from every bundle is kept** — this is the working backlog, not a curated sample. Priority (Pri) and Status are as given by the bundle evidence, with verifier-corrected statuses applied where the bundle's own adversarial verification pass demoted a claim (e.g. `BUILT→PARTIAL` where code exists but is provably never invoked in a real playthrough).

### Epoch 1 (92 items)

Epoch 1 is the corpus's foundational layer: the four-node imperial circuit, solidarity/consciousness/bifurcation mechanics, the metabolic rift, the carceral necropolitical triad, and the core wire/inspection UI shell.

### Brainstorms (80 items)

The two `ai/brainstorms/` corpora restate much of the epochs spirit in GUI/interaction-design terms (`brainstorm-gui-super`) and in deep tensor/political-economy terms (`brainstorm-tensor-data`). Expect — and the ledger confirms — heavy conceptual overlap with epochs 1/3: George Jackson Bifurcation, State Attention Threads, and the Vanguard/Trap meters all reappear here as independently-sourced confirmations of the same gaps.

| State Attention Thread system | PARTIAL | P0 | real allocation model; zero live callers, thread_cost hardcoded to 0 [VERIFIER CORRECTION: THREAD_ESCALATION is not in the 34-type bridge whitelist — nothing about attention threads reaches the frontend at all] | Surveillance-phase indicator on org rows once wired |

| George Jackson Bifurcation as central predicted outcome | PARTIAL | P0 | exact mechanic real; all 3 events dropped at bridge, invisible [VERIFIER CORRECTION: the gate reads `organization * class_consciousness >= jackson_threshold` (struggle.py:518-536), not SOLIDARITY-edge topology] | Whitelist + critical severity + bespoke triptych entry |
| Sword of Damocles — targeted-purge resilience test | PARTIAL | P1 | real compute_purge_resilience function, zero call sites [VERIFIER CORRECTION: reachable only via domain/bifurcation/analysis.py → BifurcationMonitor, which itself has zero importers — fully orphaned; engine/topology_monitor.py never references it] | "Stress-Test" button on the org InspectionCard |

## 4. The Wiring Architecture

New (or newly-surfaced) features ride one rail, end to end:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Engine System writes<br/>a graph node/edge attr"] --> B{"Registered in<br/>SEAM_REGISTRY?"}
    B -- "No — Gap 1" --> Z1["Invisible: advisory-only,<br/>no gating, no endpoint"]
    B -- "Yes" --> C["Bridge serializer<br/>(web/game/engine_bridge.py)<br/>reads the attr"]
    C --> D{"Typed row in<br/>endpoints.ts?"}
    D -- "No — Gap 2b" --> Z2["Served but undecoded:<br/>ad hoc RawEntity adapter only"]
    D -- "Yes" --> E["Panel / component<br/>fetches it"]
    E --> F{"Consumer component<br/>renders it?"}
    F -- "No" --> Z3["Fetched, stored in Redux,<br/>never displayed<br/>(the EconomyDashboard pattern)"]
    F -- "Yes" --> G["Player sees it"]
```

A parallel, structurally identical rail governs narrative events:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A2["System emits an<br/>EventType via the bus"] --> B2{"In the 34-of-79<br/>bridge whitelist?"}
    B2 -- "No" --> Z4["Dropped: returns None,<br/>never becomes a SimulationEvent"]
    B2 -- "Yes" --> C2["tick_event table +<br/>WorldState.events"]
    C2 --> D2{"Bespoke narrator<br/>template? (~10 of ~35)"}
    D2 -- "No" --> E1["Generic filler prose"]
    D2 -- "Yes" --> E2["Bespoke Continental/<br/>Liberated/Intel triptych"]
    C2 --> F2{"In _EVENT_SEVERITY?<br/>(11 of 34)"}
    F2 -- "No" --> G1["Defaults to<br/>'informational'"]
    F2 -- "Yes" --> G2["Correct severity,<br/>drives autopause/toasts"]
```

**The critical structural fact:** `SEAM_REGISTRY` today equals `_MAP_METRICS` literally — 10 rows, all `scope=MAP`. The `SeamScope` enum already declares `TERRITORY`, `ECONOMY`, `ENDGAME`, and `EVENT` as future surfaces, but **zero rows exist for them** — these are declared-but-unpopulated rails, not built ones. Sensor 1's gating power (byte-for-byte parity, tick-payload existence, severity vocabulary) only actually covers the map lens today; everything in economy/endgame/event/territory space can drift silently past it.

**The 82-row seam-wiring punch-list (`reports/seam-wiring-punchlist.md`) is not a separate backlog from this one — it is the SAME missing wiring, discovered from the opposite direction.** The punch-list found these gaps by sweeping the current tree; this audit found many of the *same* gaps by reading 30-year-old vision docs and asking "does this exist yet?" The overlap is the single most important finding of §4:

| Punch-list gap | What it is | Vision items that collapse into this ONE fix | Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Gap 1** — unregistered `tick_*` attrs | 26 real per-tick economics values computed by `TickDynamicsSystem`, never in `SEAM_REGISTRY` or any endpoint ("the richest untapped signal") | Credit Cycle Phase, Reproduction-Conditions Health Checklist, Disproportionality Crisis, Financialization Bubble Meter, Domestic Throughput Position, Class Position/5-Class Model, Crisis Detector & Devaluation Engine, Housing Value Decomposition, Counter-Tendencies Dashboard, Watchable Crisis Timeline, Tension & Metabolic Gauges, Consciousness Gap Gauge, Stability Index, Reserve Army Wage Discipline Gauge | 20+ |
| **Bridge event whitelist** (34-of-79 EventTypes) | Everything outside a hand-written if/elif ladder in `simulation_engine.py` returns `None` and is silently discarded | George Jackson Bifurcation (appears independently in 3 bundles), Sudden Collapse Cliffs, Four-Phase Terminal Crisis Cascade, Dispossession Events (2 bundles), Fascist Strategy of Tension, Ecological Overshoot (3 bundles), Reserve Army Pressure, State Attention Thread escalation, Legal Frameworks, Threshold-Triggered Narrative Events, Carceral Geography's dispossession beat | 15+ |
| **Narrator template coverage** (~10 of ~35 wire-reaching types) | Events that DO reach the wire still render generic filler prose | Solidarity-through-Struggle, Imperial Client-State Subsidy, Chauvinism/RED_BROWN_COUP, Inheritance Flow, most of the Four-Phase Cascade stages | 10+ |
| **Severity map** (11 of 34) | Dramatic events default to `informational` severity, missing autopause/critical-toast treatment | RUPTURE (client-side classifier already fixes this independently), Fascist Recruitment/Drift, Control-Ratio Crisis, Terminal Decision | 5+ |
| **Gap 2a** — dark endpoints | A serializer that calls a bridge method deleted along with `MockEngineBridge` (`efeb4a04`) | Backend-agnostic Graph Query API, Synchronized Network/Graph Topology View, Topology Legibility (percolation/centrality) | 3 |
| **Gap 2b** — Untyped-but-served rows | Serializer exists, no typed TS contract, decoded via an ad hoc `RawEntity` adapter | Vanguard Resource Triad, Ideological Trap Detectors, Historical Chronicle/Time-Travel Queries, the 5 click-to-inspect entity routes | ~33 rows / ~10 vision items |
| **Gap 3** — phantom fields | TS interface declares a field the Python serializer never emits | Metabolic Rift/Biocapacity, territory_type invisibility (recurs 3×), Color-Coded Wealth Trajectory Chart | 12 fields / ~6 vision items |
| **Orphaned DI** (constructed, never invoked) | A real calculator is registered as an injectable service and zero System ever calls it | Counter-Tendencies to TRPF, Class Mobility Transition Matrix, Disproportionality Crisis, the entire `RuleBasedStateAI`/Feature-039 family (State Action Menu, Attention Threads, Legal Frameworks, Legitimacy tiers) | 10+ |

Two consequences follow directly. First, **fixing the punch-list's Gap 1 and the event whitelist is the single highest-leverage move available** — it closes roughly 35-40 distinct PARTIAL vision items across every bundle in this report with two mechanical, well-precedented changes (add a registry row; add a whitelist entry), not new engine math. Second, **the "orphaned DI" pattern deserves its own remediation pass**: `RuleBasedStateAI`, `ThreadManager.allocate_threads`, `compute_disproportionality`, `ClassTransitionComputer.stationary_distribution`, and the counter-tendency calculator are all real, tested, non-trivial code that has *never executed in a real playthrough* — not because it's unwired to the frontend, but because nothing in the engine's own tick loop calls it. This is a distinct failure mode from the seam-wiring gap and should be tracked separately (candidate: a "reachability sentinel" alongside the existing 5 sentinels, checking that every constructed service has at least one call site exercised by a real scenario).

---

## 5. Ranked Build-Out Roadmap

Six waves, ordered so that Wave 1 is the smallest set that makes the epochs *spirit* felt in play — and, not coincidentally, the cheapest, since it touches zero new engine math. Waves 2-3 absorb the bulk of the punch-list overlap from §4. Waves 4-6 grow more expensive and more genuinely new as they go.

**THE MOCK DOCTRINE (owner directive, 2026-07-14 — governs every wave).** Anything in this
build-out that does not yet exist in the codebase still gets a rendered surface, **explicitly
badged as MOCK in the chrome** — never silently fake (that would violate Sensor-3 provenance and
the honest-Φ rule). The existing pattern to follow is the MSW narration mock gated on
`VITE_MOCK_NARRATION` with its bundle-honesty test: mock data lives behind an env-gated MSW
handler, the surface carries a visible MOCK badge, and a guard test proves no mock payload can
ship in a production bundle. Every mock surface is therefore a *visible work order*: wiring it
real = deleting the badge and riding the sentinel rails (seam-registry observable → serializer →
`endpoints.ts` typed row), which the bridge sweep then verifies mechanically. Concretely: a
MISSING row whose wave has arrived ships its panel/lens/meter as a badged mock first, so the
frontend shape is settled and reviewable while the engine/serializer work proceeds underneath it.

**OWNER RULING (2026-07-14, post-audit) — emergence over scripted conclusions.** "I want Babylon
to be as emergent as possible. No conclusion should be pre-programmed, the conclusions emerge from
the physics engine." Two consequences for this backlog: (1) the five pre-determined terminal
outcomes (EndgameDetector's REVOLUTIONARY_VICTORY … FRAGMENTED_COLLAPSE) are now a *direction to
unwind* — the Victoria-3 model ("a game is a century, it ends when it ends") replaces adjudicated
endings; the detector's classifications survive as recognized *patterns* narrated on the wire, not
as run-terminating verdicts. Endgame-flavored rows in this ledger (RED_OGV, Colonial-Stance-Gated
Endgames, Sovereign Collapse→Succession) remain valid *physics* — the Wave-1 CLAIMS-seeding fix
stands — but their frontend surfaces should present emergent configurations, never "you have
reached ending #4". (2) Abstract event *templates* (e.g. a RIOT schema the AI fills with
game-universe-specific detail) are the sanctioned narration shape — structure without scripting;
this resolves the pending narrator-remediation triage in favor of outcome-aware template
narration. Full record: `project/programs/17-living-engine.md` § Owner rulings 2026-07-14.

### Wave 1 — Make the Spine Felt (P0, no new engine math)

The smallest set that makes the corpus's signature dramatic beats — the bifurcation, the collapse, the trap — actually visible. Every item here reuses state the engine already computes every tick; the work is whitelisting, registering, and rendering, not building.

1. **Widen the bridge event whitelist** for the corpus's most-repeated missing drama: George Jackson Bifurcation (`POWER_VACUUM`/`REVOLUTIONARY_OFFENSIVE`/`FASCIST_REVANCHISM` — independently named as a top gap in 3 separate bundles), Fascist Strategy of Tension (`POGROM`/`LOCKOUT`/`VIGILANTISM`/`SPONTANEOUS_RIOT`), Dispossession Events, the Four-Phase Terminal Crisis Cascade's severity, Ecological Overshoot.
2. **Fix the Feedforward lie**: wire `VerbForm`'s hardcoded constant-direction chip to the already-built, already-typed, currently-dead `preview_action`/`actionsPreview` endpoint. Real deltas exist server-side today.
3. **Vanguard Resource Triad + Ideological Trap Detectors meters** on the org InspectionCard — both fully computed and attached to every snapshot, zero renderer today. This alone makes doctrine legible without building a single new engine formula.
4. **Consciousness/agitation/inequality ValueRows** on the class InspectionCard (Multi-dimensional Consciousness, Intra-Class Inequality, Class Position Formula) — all computed, none rendered.
5. **Fix the CLAIMS-edge seeding bug** (`seed_sovereigns.json`'s territory IDs never match any real scenario's territory keys). This single bug silently kills Sovereign Collapse→Succession, the Colonial-Stance-Gated Endgames/Red Settler Trap, and Extraction-Policy→Habitability across two bundles — the highest-leverage *engine* fix in this entire audit, since everything downstream of it (the habitability lens, the RED_OGV ending) is currently a dead rail dressed as a live one.
6. **Four-node Imperial Circuit mini-Sankey** on the class InspectionCard, built from the edge `value_flow` that SocialRole + ImperialRentSystem's 5-phase circuit already compute every tick — distinct from the SUPERSEDED "4-Class Imperial Circuit as the literal playable core loop" abstract node diagram (§6 item 5): this renders the real, live circuit data the inspector already has access to, it does not resurrect the abstract diagram.
7. **Bespoke MASS_AWAKENING/FASCIST_DRIFT narrator templates** for The Fascist Bifurcation — `route_agitation_to_ternary` runs live every tick and both events already reach the wire (they're in the bridge whitelist, unlike bullet 1's POWER_VACUUM/POGROM); the gap here is narration-only — generic filler prose instead of a bespoke Continental/Liberated/Intel triptych — plus an agitation-split breakdown widget.

### Wave 2 — Light the Economic Substrate

Absorbs the bulk of Gap 1 (§4). Turns "the engine computes it" into "the player can read it."

- Register ~20 Gap-1 `tick_*` attrs as new `SeamScope.TERRITORY`/`ECONOMY` rows: Credit Cycle Phase, Reproduction-Conditions Health Checklist, Disproportionality Crisis, Financialization Bubble Meter, Housing Value Decomposition, Class Distribution/5-Class Model, Domestic Core/Periphery Throughput Position, Crisis Detector & Devaluation Engine (business-cycle events) — the brainstorm-tensor-data ledger's own top-priority gap.
- Build the **EconomyDashboard panel** — data is mostly ready (`panels.economy` fetches every tick, zero component reads it) — absorbing Falling Rate of Bribery/Rent Pool, Color-Coded Wealth Trajectory Chart, Tension & Metabolic Gauges, Consciousness Gap Gauge, Watchable Crisis Timeline in one build.
- New map lenses: `throughput_position`, `agitation` (the Revolutionary Potential Index — computed live, zero seam row, "highest-leverage single win" per the epoch2-data bundle), `territory_type` categorical (this is also what makes the Necropolitical Triad and carceral geography visible for the first time).
- **Survival-probability duel chart** (P(S|A) vs. P(S|R)) — the cheapest, most thematically central chart identified anywhere in this audit; both series are already computed and typed.

### Wave 3 — Vanguard Praxis Becomes Playable

- Un-disable `investigate`/`move`/`negotiate` verbs — real handlers exist; the frontend's own disabling comment is factually false. Near-zero cost.
- Entitlement/Volatility/Chauvinism BreakdownBars on the class card; bespoke `RED_BROWN_COUP` template.
- **Invoke the orphaned DI cluster**: wiring `RuleBasedStateAI`'s `faction_balance` gate (i.e., making at least one scenario create a `STATE_APPARATUS` org with that attribute) is a single unlock that makes State Action Menu, Attention Threads, Legal Frameworks, and Legitimacy-Gated RoE Tiers — currently real code that has *never once executed* — reachable in a real playthrough for the first time.
- Org-heat, Reputation, and Reformist Drift meters (data mostly real, some hardcoded to 0.0 pending the invocation above).

### Wave 4 — Topology & the Gramscian Wire

- Rebuild `get_org_network`/`get_hypergraph_communities` (Gap 2a — the backing bridge methods were deleted along with `MockEngineBridge`) so the already-installed-but-unused sigma/graphology canvas becomes a real 4th takeover ("Network").
- Critical-nodes/centrality map lens; percolation-ratio HUD chip (both formulas are real and internal-only today).
- Distinct visual treatment for `CLIENT_STATE`/`SOLIDARITY` edges; edge-weight history sparkline in InspectionStack.

### Wave 5 — Repression Geography & Fog of War

- Categorical Displacement/carceral-status lens (Reservation/Penal Colony/Concentration Camp) — the single fix that finally makes the built-and-live Necropolitical Triad visible to a player.
- Coercive-infrastructure loader (HIFLD/MIRTA) — a data-layer prerequisite, not a frontend task; feeds the same lens honestly once it lands.
- **Epistemic Horizon / fog of war** (Three Vision States: Desert/Mud/Water) — the biggest net-new mechanic in this wave; gates on nothing else and is genuinely new engine + frontend work.

### Wave 6 — Doctrine, Theory & the Data Catch-Up

The most expensive wave, and correctly last: almost everything here is genuine new work, not wiring.

- **Doctrine Tree DAG + Theoretical Labor + the Four Trunks** — a wholly new feature (5th takeover), the single largest coherent MISSING cluster in the whole audit.
- **Census ACS demographic loaders** (Program 098) — unlocks race-disaggregated wealth, income-bracket ratios, housing/rent-burden composition; currently 13 orphaned fact tables with zero consumer.
- Metabolic Hysteresis engine formula (permanent ecological damage — "the earth remembers").
- Real-wage CPI deflation series (closes the "wages never naked" gap named repeatedly across epoch2-data and epoch3-economy).

**Deferred entirely, pending explicit owner scoping** (not part of any wave above — real but low-confidence-of-payoff without a data or design decision first): FAF5 freight/tribute visualization (blocked on a loader that has never existed in any form), soundtrack/audio wiring (assets exist, zero playback code), multi-scenario branching/checkpoint-restore, RAG-as-playthrough-archive (vs. the currently-wired static-theory RAG), the Detroit historical-validation case study, and the full ISA/ideological-cartography data program (HIFLD schools/broadcast towers).

## 6. Superseded & Obsolete Appendix

What **NOT** to build, and why — the ~14 items where a later, owner-ratified decision already replaced the epochs' specific mechanic with a different one that serves the same thematic intent. Building the corpus's original version of any of these would be regressive, not additive.

1. **Metabolic dashboard visualizations** (gauge/trend/health-map/consumption-breakdown widgets) — superseded by the live, `MUST_BE_LIVE` habitability MAP lens + StatChip probes; "the map IS the screen" already delivers the intent with less chrome.
2. **Liberalism as a decaying starting condition, not a faction** — superseded by a concrete, seeded `FAC_LIBERAL_IMPERIAL` faction (spec-070), already visible in Outliner and the faction map lens.
3. **Named multiple failure/defeat states** (campaign-stage-tied) — superseded by the 5 material-conditions-driven `GameOutcome`s (`EndgameDetector`), already built and rendered by `EndStateScreen`.
4. **Bunker control-room dashboard aesthetic** — superseded by the later, binding "THE INSTALLER" ksbc palette ruling (owner, 2026-07-11), same felt intent, byte-locked design tokens.
5. **4-Class Imperial Circuit as the literal playable core loop** (an abstract node diagram) — superseded by the real per-county Leontief/Φ map, already the default lens (Program 17 Wave 1's crown result).
6. **Two-pane cockpit layout** (fixed controls+map split) — superseded by the ratified, full-bleed "map IS the screen" AppShell/FloatingPanel system.
7. **Cohesive dark "Bunker Constructivism" visual identity** — same INSTALLER/ksbc ruling as #4; a duplicate ask that recurs across corpora.
8. **Influencer Trap vs. Reading Group Trap vs. the Balanced Path** — superseded by `trap_detection.py`'s mechanically-equivalent Liberal/Rightist trap axes (same failure-archetype spirit, different labels — fold the flavor text in, don't build a parallel system).
9. **Labor Aristocracy Collapse / Proletarianization** (a scripted wage-threshold event) — superseded by `DecompositionSystem`'s real, wired 30/70 `CLASS_DECOMPOSITION` split (a different concrete trigger, same "material rug-pull" narrative beat).
10. **Demographic Fascist Bifurcation** (a literal 3-pathway FASCIST/SOCIALIST/IMPERIAL decision tree) — superseded by the live `colonial_stance`→`extraction_policy`→`RED_OGV`/`REVOLUTIONARY_VICTORY` causality that already exists.
11. **Profit Crisis & Solidarity-Gated Bifurcation** — superseded by `StruggleSystem`'s George Jackson power-vacuum bifurcation (identical structural shape; that mechanic itself still needs bridge-whitelisting — see Wave 1 — but do not build a parallel `PROFIT_CRISIS` system).
12. **RAG-as-permission-system** (an LLM deciding what's mechanically possible) — explicitly rejected by ADR034 and the Constitution's engine-adjudicates principle; the typed `VerbGrid`/`TargetPicker` menu is the compliant, shipped substitute.
13. **Six-stage free-text input validation pipeline** — moot; there is no free-text command surface to validate. The structured verb menu is validation-by-construction.
14. **Compositional verb+object+modifier action grammar** — superseded by the fixed 9-verb + target + param structured grammar, consistent with "the engine adjudicates, AI never controls mechanics."

### Explicitly future-scoped in the source vision itself (not a gap — the corpus already deferred these)

Distinct from SUPERSEDED: these items are MISSING from code, but the epochs/brainstorm documents *themselves* label them out-of-scope for the current vision, not urgent unbuilt work. Listed for completeness, not for roadmap inclusion: Liberation mechanics (sinks converting back to liberated zones), Reproductive/care labor as active biocapacity restoration, Migration between territories, Warfare and climate modeling as future biocapacity threats, Gendered Reproductive Labor & Household Pooling, the BondiAlgorithm's dramatic-arc shaping, Dynamic layered live music, and Multi-scenario parallel/branching timelines.
