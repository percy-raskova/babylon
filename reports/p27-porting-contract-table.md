# Program 27 — Porting Contract Table (Phase 0 scaffold)

**Status:** Phase 0 scaffold — created 2026-07-29. Closed in Phase 3 (spec §8.4:
"the single named artifact — every earlier 'port checklist' reference means
this"). The **Sign-off** column is intentionally empty; it fills in as each
system's Rust port lands a reviewed, mutation-validated law suite.

**Source of truth for system membership/order:**
`src/babylon/engine/simulation_engine.py:328-363` (`_SYSTEM_CLASSES`, 34
entries — the CLAUDE.md "33" is stale by one, per spec §6.4).

**Classification counts (spec §6.4):** BSL_RULES 17 · HYBRID 12 ·
RUST_INTRINSIC 5 = 34.

**Coverage counts (live gate-coverage sentinel, cross-checked mechanically
against `tools/regression_scenarios.py::SCENARIO_COVERAGE_DATA` /
`COVERAGE_GAPS_DATA` for this table):** 17 systems evidenced by canonical
scenarios, 17 declared `CoverageGap` rows, 0 blind. The freeze-tag floor
(Task 17) is **all 34** — a `CoverageGap` row alone does not survive the
freeze; Task 11 backfills each gapped system with a property law or
transcribed unit suite, or a Director-signed waiver.

## Method

- **Classification / float-hazard inventory:** transcribed verbatim from spec
  §6.4 (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-28-program-27-refoundation-design.md`).
- **LOC:** `wc -l` on each system's home file (`src/babylon/engine/systems/*.py`
  for all but the three domain-hosted systems below).
- **RNG usage:** mechanical grep for `resolve_rng(` call sites (not merely the
  import — every system imports `kernel.system_base`, which *defines*
  `resolve_rng`, so import-presence alone is a false positive). Five systems
  actually call it: FactionInfluence, FascistFaction (`reactionary.py`),
  Electoral, Doctrine, Struggle. A sixth — OODASystem — threads RNG
  transitively through `ooda/npc_stub.py::select_npc_actions` into
  `ooda/state_ai/{decision,repress_effects,administer_effects}.py`
  (`random.Random(rng_seed)` at each), confirmed by direct read, not grep
  alone.
- **`round()` sites — in-tick vs presentational:** direct file scan plus one
  import-hop into each system's own imported formula/domain modules, then each
  hit was **opened and read** to separate real production rounding from
  `>>> round(...)` doctest examples (the doctest ones are presentational only
  — they exist to pin a formula's documented example output, not to touch tick
  state). This is a **1-hop trace, not an exhaustive transitive closure** —
  deeper multi-hop round() sites (e.g. `domain/economics/circulation/turnover.py`,
  reachable from `ImperialRentSystem` only through the optional
  `_invoke_n_if_wired` → `engine/systems/n.py` (`Vol2CirculationStep`) gated
  sub-stage) are flagged, not fully traced, and are a candidate for the Task 17
  pre-freeze deep audit rather than re-litigated here.
- **Coverage instrument:** mechanically extracted from
  `tools/regression_scenarios.py::SCENARIO_COVERAGE_DATA` (scenario names) and
  `COVERAGE_GAPS_DATA` (gap reason, truncated) via `ast.literal_eval` over the
  parsed module (the sentinel `src/babylon/sentinels/gate_coverage/checks.py`
  parses the same literal).

## The 34-row table

| 9 | SolidaritySystem | BSL_RULES | 202 | none named in spec §6.4 inventory | none found | none found | GAPPED — Task 11 (every SOLIDARITY edge across all five scenarios has `solidarity_strength=0.0`; the transmission loop's early-continue guard skips every edge every tick) | pure BSL rules, no named intrinsic | |

## Corrections against the injected Task-2 tick-profile evidence

Task 2's tick-profile handoff describes 23/34 systems as carrying a ratified
`budget.json` ceiling and lists the remainder (`AllegianceSystem`,
`DoctrineSystem`, `ElectoralSystem`, `PolicySystem`, `MarketScissorsSystem`,
`WealthDistributionSystem`, `EpistemicHorizonSystem`, `CommunitySystem`) as
uncovered by that budget file — a **separate** gap axis (perf-budget
coverage) from this table's coverage-instrument column (scenario/property-law
coverage). The two axes are not the same: e.g. `MarketScissorsSystem` has a
ratified perf budget missing from `budget.json`'s named list per Task 2, but
**does** have scenario coverage per this table (`imperial_circuit`,
`single_county`, `two_node`); `CommunitySystem` is gapped on **both** axes.
This table intentionally does not merge the two — Task 2's report
(`reports/tick-profile-2026-07-29.md`, if landed) is the perf-budget axis's
home.

## Corrections against the injected Task-6 handoff

Task 6 (TickContext key census) is marked `UNAVAILABLE` in this run's inputs
(the upstream agent failed). No TickContext-key column was requested for this
table (spec §8.4's named columns are classification, LOC, float hazards, RNG
usage, `round()` sites, coverage instrument, BSL-vs-intrinsic split,
sign-off), so this gap does not block Task 10 — it blocks whichever task
depends on the key census directly.

## Open items for Task 17 (pre-freeze deep audit)

1. `ImperialRentSystem`'s gated `n.py` (`Vol2CirculationStep`) sub-stage's
   `round()`/RNG closure was not traced past one hop in this scaffold — resolve
   before the freeze tag.
2. `OODASystem`'s `ooda/state_ai/observability.py` (3 `round()` hits) was not
   confirmed reachable or unreachable from the tick path — resolve before the
   freeze tag.
3. All 17 `CoverageGap` rows above are Task 11's floor — the freeze tag blocks
   until each carries a property law, a transcribed unit suite, or a
   Director-signed waiver row (fixes M14, spec §8).
