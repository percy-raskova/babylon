//! Top-form declarations (`bsl-language.rst` §2.2's `<top-form>`): the
//! `deffield` and `intrinsic` forms, read into the registries the
//! typechecker and the fuel bound checker consume. Every check here is a
//! **load** check (§3): there is no partial load and no "skip the bad
//! declaration" mode.
//!
//! R9 chapter C1 lands three rulings in this module:
//!
//! - a `deffield`'s first segment may name a `NodeType`, an `EdgeType` **or**
//!   a `HyperedgeType` member (D31) — an unregistered segment is
//!   `E-LOAD-023`, resolved through [`crate::vocabulary`];
//! - every `EdgeType` carries one **implicitly declared** field,
//!   `<edge-type>/strength`, `:type coefficient` `:kind extensive` (D32;
//!   lowercase per D94 — type names are lowercase symbols, ADR191 R4).
//!   Re-declaring it explicitly is `E-LOAD-001`, a duplicate field
//!   declaration, so there is exactly one home for its type and kind;
//! - every §5.2 form-head symbol is **reserved against the intrinsic
//!   namespace** (D33): declaring an intrinsic with one is `E-LOAD-024`,
//!   checked against the §5.2 list itself so adding a form tag automatically
//!   reserves it.
