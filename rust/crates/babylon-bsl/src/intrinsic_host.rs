    // ---- ADR219 rider train (Director ruling 2026-08-22): the six
    // exact-arithmetic intrinsics — `sqrt`, `round-half-even`, `min`, `max`,
    // `abs`, `clamp`. None is a transcendental: each crosses via an IEEE-754
    // exactly-specified operation (correctly-rounded `sqrt`;
    // `roundTiesToEven`; comparison/copysign arithmetic), so the pinned
    // soft-float libm and §4.3's golden-vector clause do not apply — the
    // floor rider's disposition (§3.10, D97), recorded per-intrinsic in the
    // spec's normative paragraphs. All six refuse a non-finite argument
    // loudly (E-EVAL-044, `IntrinsicOutOfDomain`) rather than propagate
    // NaN/±inf (§4.3: non-finite values are unrepresentable at any
    // observable point, so the check is defense in depth), and refuse a
    // non-`Real`-lane argument rather than coercing (§3.1/§3.3, the
    // `eval_floor` rule). No result-side re-check exists on any of the six:
    // every one of them maps finite inputs to a finite, exactly-specified
    // result (unlike `exp`'s overflow lane, E-EVAL-014), so a result guard
    // would be dead code — that omission is this comment's explicit
    // disposition, not an oversight.
