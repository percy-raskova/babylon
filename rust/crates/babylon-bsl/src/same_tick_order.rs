//! Same-tick ordering as LOAD REFUSALS (Task W2, BSL Hygiene Knock-out —
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-18-bsl-hygiene-knockout.md` §Task W2,
//! amended by `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-18-bsl-hygiene-knockout/task-w2-
//! brief.md` and its binding `prep-adjudication.md`).
//!
//! **Boundary ruling (Director, 2026-08-18 ~13:40 EDT), the reason this is
//! a load-time check and not an external lint:** "if you need a sentinel
//! that's a code smell for you need to expand BSL" — semantic coherence
//! belongs IN the language as a load/type refusal, not bolted on
//! afterward. This module adds two such refusals, in the same family as
//! `E-LOAD-001` (content-set-wide, checked at load, over whatever content
//! set the caller actually loaded — never a hypothetical wider one).
//!
//! **PER-19 rank-aware boundary (after ADR222).** [`diagnose_ranked`] consumes
//! the tick driver's resolved execution ranks and uses D16 bytes only as a
//! same-rank tie-break. [`diagnose`] remains an all-rank-zero adapter for
//! historical audits and fixtures whose rules genuinely share one rank.
//! ADR224 retains deterministic sequential execution for rules at the same
//! rank. Aggregate enforcement is live only after phase compilation over the
//! complete concatenated content set.
//!
//! **Refusal 1 — `E-LOAD-058`, stale-default read.** For every
//! `(binding … :field f :optional :default d)` in rule `R`, compute `f`'s
//! *writer set*: every OTHER rule `W` in the content set with an
//! `(update-node … f (<op> …))` effect, **excluding `W` where
//! `W.rule_id == R.rule_id`** (adjudication §(c), verbatim, keyed on rule
//! IDENTITY, never on write TARGET — `solidarity/p0-transmit` reads `self`
//! and writes `it`, same rule, and must still self-exclude). If any
//! remaining writer's `(execution rank, rule-id bytes)` key does not sort
//! strictly before `R`'s (§4.2/D116), `R` can observe `d` on a tick where
//! that writer already ran and left a real value from an EARLIER tick —
//! refused.
//!
//! **Refusal 2 — `E-LOAD-059`, unreset fan-in.** A field written by 2+
//! distinct rules in the content set needs its execution-earliest writer to be
//! either an unconditional `set` or the D127 unconditional-recompute shape
//! (adjudication §(d), verbatim: unconditional = no `(when …)` at all, or
//! a `(when …)` whose condition is the literal `#t`; the qualifying reset
//! must also be a direct child of `(effects …)`, because nested `guard` and
//! `for-each` bodies may execute zero times) — else refused as an accumulation
//! with no rule-identifiable reset.
//!
//! **ADR224 governed dispositions.** Exact rows below record the landed
//! intentional E058/E059 findings. A disposition is default-deny: an unknown
//! reader, binding, field, writer, execution-earliest writer, or reset shape
//! still refuses. The earlier `ai/_inbox/amendment-prior-tick-draft.md`
//! remains historical evidence only; it is not active authority and no future
//! `:prior-tick` vocabulary is required for this enforcement.
