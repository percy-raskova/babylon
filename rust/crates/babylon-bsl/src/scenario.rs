//! The world-load path: a scenario file becomes a populated
//! [`GraphSubstrate`] (P27 Phase 2 Slice 1).
//!
//! Before this module the Rust engine had no way to obtain a world at all —
//! every graph in the tree was built by hand in a test. A rule cannot run
//! against a world that does not exist, so this is the first half of the
//! vertical slice; the tick loop is the second.
//!
//! # Why s-expressions and not a new format
//!
//! The reader, its error codes, and its NFC/escape discipline already exist
//! ([`crate::reader`]). A scenario is content, and the project already has a
//! content language — inventing a second one would mean a second lexer, a
//! second error vocabulary, and a second place for encoding bugs to live.
//!
//! ```text
//! (scenario ft/two-classes
//!   (node core NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS
//!     (social-class/wages 120)
//!     (social-class/value-produced 80))
//!   (node periphery NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS
//!     (social-class/wages 20)
//!     (social-class/value-produced 90))
//!   (edge EdgeType/SOLIDARITY core periphery 1))
//! ```
//!
//! **Local names resolve edges at load time; [`LoadedScenario::node_content_ids`]
//! retains them as content identity.** `core` and `periphery` let an edge
//! name its endpoints, resolved to [`NodeId`]s during the load — the
//! substrate itself still knows nodes only by that opaque handle. But a
//! handle is hydration-order-dependent (inserting a node earlier in the file
//! shifts every later one), which is unusable as a stable identity for
//! anything computed FROM the scenario's content rather than its insertion
//! order — the future `rng-draw` intrinsic's key chief among them (plan
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-576-intrinsic-host.md` §3.4). So the
//! loader retains the inverse of its load-time local-name table on
//! [`LoadedScenario`], keyed by the [`NodeId`] each name resolved to. This is
//! content identity, not the substrate's — `babylon-graph` gains no stable-id
//! accessor, and canonical state (`state_hash`) is untouched.
//!
//! **Declaration order is the id order.** Nodes are minted top to bottom, so
//! the same file always produces the same [`NodeId`] assignment and hence the
//! same state hash. Reordering two `node` forms is a real change to the
//! scenario, not a cosmetic one — which is honest, since it changes what
//! `NodeId(0)` denotes.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not do
//!
//! - **No `Currency` attributes.** `GraphSubstrate` attributes are `f64`,
//!   which cannot hold `Currency`'s i128 micro-units; the verb layer already
//!   refuses such a write loudly rather than casting lossily. Typed
//!   attribute storage (Half 2 of the typed-attribute-seeding design,
//!   `reports/typed-attribute-seeding-design-2026-08-11.md`) is DEFERRED TO
//!   ITS FIRST CONSUMER (Director ruling, 2026-08-11 popup) — not to a fixed
//!   phase boundary — and the Fundamental Theorem will want it once it
//!   lands: wages and value produced are properly money. This module states
//!   the gap rather than hiding it.
//! - **`int`- and fractional-typed attributes only (Half 1).** An
//!   `int`-declared field takes an integer literal, exact in `f64` to 2^53.
//!   A `probability`/`intensity`/`coefficient`-declared field takes any
//!   literal that widens to `[0, 1]` — see `attribute_value` (private, this
//!   module) for the conversion contract and its determinism argument.
//! - **No hyperedges yet.** The grammar has room for them; nothing in slice 1
//!   needs one, and an unused form is an untested form.
//! - **No defaults.** A node with no attributes gets no attributes. An
//!   unwritten field errors on read (III.11), and seeding zeros here would
//!   defeat that at the one place it is easiest to defeat.

// `ScenarioError` grew past clippy's 128-byte `result_large_err` threshold
// once `identity: Option<ErrorIdentity>` (§2.3, issue #652 Task 2) joined
// `message`/`code`/`position` — `ErrorIdentity::Edge`'s three `String`s are
// the largest variant. The load path is cold (a scenario either loads once
// or the whole run fails), so paying the extra stack bytes on every
// `Result<_, ScenarioError>` is the right trade against boxing a field
// §2.3 specifies unboxed, or `Box`-wrapping every one of this module's
// ~20 pre-existing fallible signatures for a rarely-taken error branch.

/// 1. The qname's OWNER segment must name the edge's own type — §2.10
///    discipline 1's ownership law, checked at hydration through the same
///    rendering (`tick::namespace_to_node_type`)
///    `evaluator.rs::check_edge_referent_type` uses at evaluation.
/// 2. A `/strength`-suffixed qname is refused UNCONDITIONALLY — not merely
///    via the registry miss (D32's implicit field is never in
///    `scenario.fields`): `load_deffield` would ACCEPT an explicit
///    `(deffield <edge-type>/strength …)` (only `prepare_rules`'s E-LOAD-001
///    refuses it, later, at `TypeEnv` construction), and without this guard
///    the write would fall into the substrate's `/strength` fork (D143) and
///    silently rewrite the edge's mint strength slot. One datum, one writer:
///    the `(edge …)` form's own 4th slot.
/// 3. An undeclared qname is a typo, not a new field — `load_node`'s
///    registry contract verbatim.
///
/// The `(edge-type, source, target, field)` quadruple is a KEY — a second
/// seeding of one key is `E-LOAD-057`, E-LOAD-044's own argument one axis
/// wider: the file would carry two values for one datum with only the later
/// surviving, a silent overwrite.
