//! The typed structural verb algebra (`bsl-language.rst` §2.8): the seven
//! graph verbs plus `emit`, executed against any
//! [`babylon_graph::substrate::GraphSubstrate`] — generic over the store by
//! design, so this module needed no change when the production store
//! swapped from `MemoryGraph` to `HypergraphStore` at the Phase 1/2
//! boundary (ADR179 T3, executed by ADR193, 2026-08-11). This is the
//! crate-DAG edge Task 11 planned: `babylon-bsl` depends on `babylon-graph`.
//!
//! **No clique expansion exists in this module** and none may be added: a
//! member list is handed to `GraphSubstrate::add_hyperedge` whole — that is
//! Anti-Pattern VIII.9 enforced where the verbs live. There is deliberately
//! no `add-member`/`remove-member`: membership change is whole-hyperedge
//! replacement, `remove-hyperedge` then `add-hyperedge` in one effect list
//! (§2.8 draft ruling, D26 — whose member-list half **stands**).
//!
//! **`update-edge` is served (T3, ADR198 R1-R3, issue #560); `update-hyperedge`
//! remains refused loudly, with the reason named.** T3 PR A gave
//! `GraphSubstrate` full symmetric edge-attribute storage (deffield rows per
//! edge type, the empty-elided fifth canonical section), and this module's
//! collect-then-apply machinery widened to match: `update-edge` defers
//! through the same [`PendingWrite`] batch as `update-node` (the target sum
//! type [`WriteTarget`]), with `set`/`add`/`sub`/`scale` parity, enum set
//! included, and the strength fork (D143) routing `<edge-type>/strength`
//! writes to the edge's existing 0x03-slot strength. `update-hyperedge` has
//! no such charter: hyperedge own-field storage is chartered by no Program
//! 29 train (D65's runtime half; AG(i) membership payloads are #536's
//! separate ceremony, ADR198 R4), and widening that state widens the
//! canonical `state_hash` field set (Constitution III.7) — never a
//! silently-dropped write. The grammar, the §3.7 cost rows, the §2.8 static
//! checks and the error codes landed with the R9 chapters; the storage and
//! the apply path are what T3 adds.
//!
//! **I.15 stays a declared Phase-2 gap, named here rather than silently
//! absorbed** (the dossier's scope tension, recorded): nothing in this
//! module enforces the edge-mode transition law, so no E-EVAL-030 can fire
//! — the §6.2 chapter-C2 vector family's I.15 leg is unserved until the
//! machine itself is chartered.
//!
//! **`update-node` against a `currency`-declared field writes the i128
//! lane** (T3 #491, OQ-J — Half 2 of the typed-attribute-seeding design):
//! `update_node`/`collect_update_node`/[`EffectExecutor::apply_pending_write`]
//! each fork on the field's declared type BEFORE reaching
//! `numeric_write_value`'s f64 lane, routing a `Value::Currency` through
//! `GraphSubstrate::update_node_currency` instead — a SEPARATE store map,
//! never a lossy cast. Only `set` is licensed on the Currency lane;
//! `add`/`sub`/`scale` would need to pick which of Currency's five legal
//! operators (§3.2) applies, which this train does not license (mirrors
//! `refuse_arithmetic_on_enum_field`'s identical narrowness for `Enum<T>`).
//! **`update-edge` against a `currency`-declared
//! field is still refused** — there is no edge-scoped Currency lane in
//! this train, the same declared gap it always was on that side.
//!
//! **Id operands are effect-list-scoped names** (draft ruling recorded in
//! §2.8, implementation-discovered): `add-node`/`add-hyperedge`'s id
//! operand is read as a symbol naming the minted object for the rest of the
//! effect list — the substrate mints the actual identity; roster
//! replacement referencing the new hyperedge needs exactly this.
//!
//! Discipline held here, not invented here:
//! - Effects apply in **source order** (§2.8); `guard` evaluates only the
//!   taken branch (§4.1) and charges accordingly.
//! - Substrate failures surface as `E-EVAL-031` — removing what does not
//!   exist, adding what exists, unknown/duplicate members: absence is never
//!   success, and nothing is silently deduplicated.
//! - The **store boundary** runs §3.3's one range check: a written value
//!   outside the target field's declared `[0,1]` domain is `E-EVAL-020`, a
//!   loud failure, never a clamp.
//! - Fuel: verbs charge their §3.7 base cost (3), update-ops theirs (1),
//!   operand expressions charge through the Task 14 evaluator — one §4.5
//!   meter end to end.

///
/// **G1's own fix still assumed two invariants no check here established
/// (H1, #534 fix round 3 — one root cause with `grammar::

/// items), and that a payload item has exactly two elements (so
/// `pair.get(1)` finds its whole value).** Neither holds once a SECOND
/// malformation is present. `(m (emit (add-node NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS
/// 5)))` is a payload item whose value is a NESTED `emit` MISSING its own
/// type operand — `items[1]` there is `(add-node NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS
/// 5)` itself (the real verb invocation), not an `<enum-ref>`, and the
/// old unconditional `skip(2)` silently treated it as "the confirmed type
/// operand" and skipped it, so `add-node` was never inspected as a head
/// at all. `(m 1 (add-node NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS 5))` is an OVER-ARITY
/// payload item — three elements, not two — so `pair.get(1)` (the literal
