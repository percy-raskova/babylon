//! The tick: subject iteration over one loaded rule (P27 Phase 2 Slice 1).
//!
//! This is the loop the engine was missing. Every other piece existed —
//! [`crate::rule_pipeline::load_rule`] gates a rule, [`crate::evaluator`]
//! evaluates an expression, [`crate::structural_verbs::EffectExecutor`]
//! mutates a substrate — but nothing drove them over a world.
//!
//! **A rule does not loop OVER SUBJECTS; the engine does.** BSL rules are
//! written against `self` (`(update-node self social-class/agitation (add
//! 0.05i))`), so the rule states what happens to *one* subject and the
//! engine applies it to each in turn. **Corrected (#519 fix round):** this
//! used to say "that is why there is no `for-each` in the grammar" — false
//! since Task 10 (§2.8 chapter C6) added `for-each` in effect position
//! (`crate::structural_verbs`). What remains true, and is what this module
//! actually owns, is narrower: `for-each` iterates a QUERY RESULT within
//! ONE subject's effect list; it never iterates the SUBJECT population
//! itself — that population, and the order it fires in, is `run_tick`'s
//! alone, not a rule's to express.
//!
//! # The subject type, and how it is derived
//!
//! [`crate::bindings::BindSource::Field`]'s own contract is "a declared field
//! of **`self`'s node type**", so a rule's field bindings name their subject:
//! `social-class/wages` can only be read off a `social-class` node. Slice 1
//! therefore derives the subject type from the shared namespace of the
//! rule's `:field` bindings, and rejects a rule whose fields disagree —
//! because two namespaces mean two subject types, and picking one silently
//! would run the rule over the wrong population.
//!
//! **This is a slice-1 derivation, not a spec ruling.** The durable source
//! should be the `deffield` registry (Phase-2 content), which knows each
//! field's owning type without inference. Recorded here so the assumption is
//! visible rather than load-bearing-and-forgotten.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Subjects come from [`GraphSubstrate::nodes`], which is contractually
//! ascending by id, so the order rules fire in is fixed by the substrate and
//! not by storage.
//!
//! **Superseded (Task 12, P27 Phase 2 query-evaluation plan, 2026-08-11):**
//! this section used to say each subject reads through the same graph it
//! mutates and sees prior subjects' mutations, matching the frozen Python
//! engine's in-place behaviour. That was an admitted implementation/spec
//! divergence (D-row Q1), not a ruling — §4.2 chapter C4 says *"all firings
//! of one rule observe the same pre-state … and the effects they collect
//! are applied in that subject order."* [`run_tick`] now follows the spec:
//! it runs in two passes, collecting every subject's writes (via
//! [`crate::structural_verbs::EffectExecutor::collect_effects`]) against
//! the SAME pre-tick graph before applying any of them (via
//! [`crate::structural_verbs::EffectExecutor::apply_pending_write`]), in
//! subject order. Verified byte-neutral for every rule pack landed at the
//! time of the repair (`rust/crates/babylon-tick/tests/tick_goldens.rs`) —
//! none reads another node's field, so the divergence was unobservable
//! until a rule does.
//!
//! **Scope of this claim, named explicitly (#519 fix round):** the quoted
//! chapter-C4 sentence is ONE subject's worth of §4.2's own broader rule —
//! "rules **within one system position** observe the same pre-state"
//! (§4.2, the paragraph chapter C4 elaborates) — and this module only
//! repairs the WITHIN-ONE-RULE half of it (subject-to-subject). The
//! RULE-to-rule half (two rules at the same anchor position, each
//! observing the OTHER's writes rather than the tick's shared pre-state)
//! is a separate, still-open divergence: `babylon-tick`'s
//! `run_once_into`/`TickSession::advance` run each rule to completion —
//! collect AND apply — before the next rule starts, against the same
//! mutable graph. Recorded as D-row **Q14** (the query-evaluation plan's
//! draft-ruling register), latent today because every landed rule pack
//! keeps its system position to exactly one rule.
//!
//! # Fuel
//!
//! Each subject gets its own budget, taken from the rule's DECLARED
//! `:fuel` — never from `static_bound`, which is `check_rule`'s computed
//! proof that the rule fits, not the allowance it runs under.
//!
//! The budget is per-SUBJECT because the §3.7 bound is per-subject:
//! `check_rule` accepted the rule against one subject's worth of work, so
//! sharing one meter across a population would make a rule's admissibility
//! depend on how many nodes happened to exist, which is not a property of
//! the rule.

/// pre-state … and the effects they collect are applied in that subject

/// one, and that split IS the repair, not an optimisation:
///
/// - **Pass 1 — collect**, via `collect_pass`. **Repaired (CT4P
///   hardening train, issue #525, item A1):** this doc used to record an
///   admitted gap — "NLL re-acquires a `&mut` reborrow per subject … so
///   nothing at the TYPE level stops a future Pass-1 caller from mutating
///   between subjects. That Pass 1's *loop* never calls a mutating method
///   between subjects is a convention … not the compiler." `collect_pass`
///   closes that gap by taking `graph: &dyn GraphSubstrate` — an IMMUTABLE
///   substrate, for the whole loop, not just for one callee. The type
///   system now enforces the pre-state law for every subject in Pass 1: no
///   call inside `collect_pass`'s loop can mutate `graph`, because nothing
///   in scope holds a `&mut` to it. `run_tick` reborrows `&*graph` ONCE,
///   for the single call into `collect_pass` — the two existing
///   pre-state tests
///   (`all_firings_of_one_rule_observe_the_same_pre_state`,
///   `accumulation_into_a_shared_target_reduces_in_subject_order_and_keeps_every_contribution`)
///   are now redundancy on top of a type-level guarantee, not the only
///   defence. `update-node`'s writes come out as
///   [`crate::structural_verbs::PendingWrite`]s, appended to one flat,
///   RULE-wide list in subject order.
/// - **Pass 2 — apply.** `run_tick` reborrows `&mut *graph` for this pass,
///   after `collect_pass`'s immutable borrow has ended. Each collected
///   write applies in the order it was collected — subject order outer,
///   source order inner, by construction of the flat list — and `add`/
///   `sub`/`scale` read the target's CURRENT value HERE, at apply time
///   (D-row Q2), which is what lets several subjects each contribute to
///   one shared carrier without losing any contribution.
///
/// **Scope.** Only `update-node` participates in this two-pass split.
/// `emit`, `guard` and `for-each` are served inside Pass 1 (`emit` never
/// touches the graph; its payload evaluates against the same pre-state).
/// The six graph-shape verbs (`add-node`, `remove-node`, `add-edge`,
/// `remove-edge`, `add-hyperedge`, `remove-hyperedge`) are NOT served by
