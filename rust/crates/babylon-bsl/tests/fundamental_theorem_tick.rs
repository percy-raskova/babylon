//! **P27 Phase 2 Slice 1: the vertical slice, end to end.**
//!
//! Scenario file → world → loaded rule → tick → deterministic state hash.
//! Every stage is the real one; nothing here is a stub.
//!
//! This exists because until it passed, the Rust engine could parse a rule
//! and hold a graph but could not *run* anything: there was no world-load
//! path and no loop to drive rules over a population. "We have a language"
//! becomes "we have an engine" at the point this file goes green.
//!
//! # The rule under test
//!
//! The Fundamental Theorem: revolution in the core is impossible while wages
//! exceed the value produced, and the gap is imperial rent (Φ). Chosen as the
//! first rule because it is the theoretical spine every other mechanic hangs
//! off, and because it has the minimum shape a real rule needs — read
//! attributes, compare, write a derived value back.
//!
//! The scenario carries two classes drawn to make the theorem's *two* cases
//! visible in one tick, which is the point of the test:
//!
//! - a **core** class with wages 120 against value produced 80 — extracting
//!   Φ = 40, the labour-aristocracy position;
//! - a **periphery** class with wages 20 against value produced 90 — the
//!   guard is false, nothing is written, and the absence of an
//!   `imperial-rent` attribute on that node is itself the assertion.
//!
//! A rule that fired on everything would pass a weaker test. The periphery
//! class is here so the guard has to actually discriminate.
