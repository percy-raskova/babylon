//! Hyperedge-lane Task 1 (E1a): the `(hyperedge …)` scenario top-form.
//!
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-18-community-port.md`'s Task 1 — the
//! hyperedge lane's first landing. Before this train, `scenario.rs:63-64`
//! stated plainly: "No hyperedges yet. The grammar has room for them;
//! nothing in slice 1 needs one, and an unused form is an untested form."
//! Every world the Community BSL port depends on needs one, so this is that
//! form's own test file — the first thing to exercise it end to end, and the
//! file every later task's own hyperedge-touching test builds on.
//!
//! Three properties this file pins, one per Task 1 step:
//!
//! - **Step 1/2** — the top-form loads, resolves its `HyperedgeType` through
//!   the closed vocabulary (`E-LOAD-031 UnknownEnumMember` on a typo, never
//!   the field-qname code `E-LOAD-023` revision 1 of the plan wrongly
//!   prescribed), resolves each member by the same local-name table
//!   `node`/`edge` share, refuses an empty member list before ever reaching
//!   the substrate, and canonicalizes member order exactly as
//!   `structural_verbs.rs::EffectExecutor::add_hyperedge` already does.
//! - **Step 3** — `HyperedgeId`s mint on their own counter; inserting a
//!   `hyperedge` form never shifts a `NodeId`.
//! - **Step 4** — `LoadedScenario::hyperedge_types` /
//!   `LoadedScenario::max_members_seen` count the seeded population, the
//!   same way `node_types`/`edge_types` already do.
