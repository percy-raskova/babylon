//! B0's proof that the client links the engine in-process: run the Slice 1
//! seam (scenario -> rule -> one tick -> state hash) at startup and log it.
//!
//! B2 Task 13 added `EngineSession` — the client's own held, persistent
//! `TickSession`, plus the fips<->`NodeId` map and the tick-0 population
//! baseline the map lenses (`lens.rs`) need. `engine_link_probe` stays
//! exactly as B0 left it (`tests/engine_link.rs`'s pinned-hash test still
//! exercises it); `EngineSession` is a separate surface.
//!
//! **B3 wave-1 Task 5 (plan §2.5/§3.2).** `EngineSession::start` is now
//! GENERIC over any catalog [`crate::story::Story`] rather than the
//! counties-only constructor B2 shipped: the fips<->`NodeId` roster is
//! DERIVED through `crate::story::roster_from_loaded` (never the old
//! hand-transcribed `DEMO_FIPS`, deleted by this task), and the session id
//! is the story's own `session_id` (§3.5), never the retired
//! `"babylon-client-b2-demo"` placeholder. `start_over` (Task 4's narrow
//! seam for the carceral story ahead of this catalog landing) is deleted —
//! absorbed into this wider `start`, exactly as its own doc comment named.
