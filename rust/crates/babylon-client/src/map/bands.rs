//! Presentation color constants for the county map that live outside the
//! §9b role palette (`crate::palette`).
//!
//! **F4 fix (adversarial verification of PR #490).** The first cut
//! declared `PANEL` as a private `const` inline in `map/mesh.rs`. That
//! bypassed `tests/unit/render/test_rust_theme_parity.py`'s §9b parity
//! guard, which reads only `palette.rs` — not a false pass on `PANEL`
//! itself (`PANEL` is deliberately not a §9b token, so the guard was never
//! supposed to claim it), but a genuine gap: nothing watched for a STRAY
//! `Color::srgb_u8`/`Color::srgb` literal added to any OTHER file in this
//! crate. Two things close that gap: (1) `PANEL` now lives here, in the
//! file the B1 plan's Task 9 (Phase C, out of scope for this PR) is
//! specced to create and extend with the four-band diverging tension
//! channel (`pub fn band_color`, `pub const PANEL`) — so Task 9 finds one
//! existing declaration to extend, not a second one to reconcile; (2) the
//! parity guard itself grew a crate-wide sweep
//! (`test_no_stray_color_literals_outside_palette_or_a_declared_exemption`)
//! that fails on any `Color::srgb[_u8]` call outside `palette.rs` unless
//! its file is named in the guard's own `_SWEEP_EXEMPTIONS` registry with
//! a reason — `map/bands.rs` (this file) is that registry's first entry.
//!
//! **B2 Phase C, Task 10 (this edit).** Three band tables — Tension
//! (ADR191 R11's four-band diverging channel, ported unmodified),
//! Legitimation (Director ruling 1: reuses PANEL/DIM/CRIMSON), Population
//! Trend (BLOCKER 2 fix: sign-only, reuses all four tokens) — plus the
//! `ActiveLens`/`LensChanged` types and the one recolor system all three
//! lenses share. No new `Color::srgb[_u8]` literal: `DIM`/`CRIMSON`/`GOLD`
//! come from `crate::palette`, `PANEL` stays declared in this file.
//!
//! **Mechanical fix, recorded rather than silently applied.** The plan's
//! own code for this task spells the county-recolor signal
//! `#[derive(Event)] … EventReader<LensChanged> … EventWriter<LensChanged>`.
//! Bevy 0.18 renamed that whole buffered pub/sub family: `Event`/
//! `EventReader`/`EventWriter`/`App::add_event` are now the
//! *observer/trigger* system (`World::trigger`, `On<T>`); the buffered
//! queue this plugin actually needs is `Message`/`MessageReader`/
//! `MessageWriter`/`App::add_message` (confirmed by reading
//! `bevy_ecs::message`'s module tree and `bevy_ecs::prelude`, which
//! exports `Message`/`MessageReader`/`MessageWriter`/`Messages` but no
//! `EventReader`/`EventWriter` at all). `LensChanged` is declared
//! `#[derive(Message)]` here and read/written through
//! `MessageReader`/`MessageWriter` throughout this plan's remaining tasks
//! — the `.read()`/`.write(...)` method calls the plan's own code already
//! uses are unchanged, since those method names carried over from the old
//! API to the new one.
