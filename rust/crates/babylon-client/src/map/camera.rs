//! The county map's bounded pan/zoom camera (B1 Task 7).
//!
//! `PanCamera` (`bevy::camera_controller::pan_camera`, the `pan_camera`
//! feature) drives panning (WASD) and zoom (mouse wheel / +/-) by writing
//! its `zoom_factor` straight into the camera entity's own `Transform`
//! scale (`run_pancamera_controller` in the crate: `transform.scale =
//! Vec3::splat(controller.zoom_factor)`). Under `ScalingMode::WindowSize`
//! with `OrthographicProjection::scale` left at its default `1.0` (this
//! module never touches it), that transform scale IS "world metres visible
//! per screen pixel" — so `zoom_factor` and this module's `clamp_camera`'s
//! `zoom` parameter are the same number.
//!
//! **A naming collision worth flagging explicitly** (the plan's Task 7
//! Step 1 prose vs. `PanCamera`'s own fields): the plan describes
//! "MAX_ZOOM" as the CLOSEST-IN bound ("one median county fills a third of
//! the viewport"). But `PanCamera.zoom_factor` runs the opposite way from
//! that prose: a SMALLER `zoom_factor` means fewer world metres map into
//! the same pixel count, i.e. MORE zoomed in; a LARGER `zoom_factor` means
//! more zoomed out. (Confirmed by reading `run_pancamera_controller`:
//! `zoom_factor -= zoom_amount`, and `zoom_amount` is positive for a
//! forward/up scroll — the intuitive "scroll up to zoom in" gesture
//! decreases `zoom_factor`.) So the plan's prose "MAX_ZOOM" (closest-in)
//! is `PanCamera.min_zoom` here, and its "MIN_ZOOM" (whole map visible,
//! "fully zoomed out") is `PanCamera.max_zoom`. This module names its own
//! constants and functions by their EFFECT rather than reusing the
//! ambiguous MIN/MAX prose, and every doc comment says which `PanCamera`
//! field it feeds.
//!
//! **Fix round (adversarial verification of PR #490, F1/F10).** The first
//! cut left `pan_speed`/`zoom_speed` at `PanCamera::default()`'s values
//! (500.0, 0.1) — WORLD units, and this world is Albers metres (atlas
//! `world_bounds` roughly 4.6M x 4.3M m). Measured against the committed
//! atlas at the opening (whole-map) zoom on a 1280x720 viewport: panning
//! moved about 0.084 px/s (hours to cross one screen), and reaching the
//! zoomed-in limit took tens of thousands of scroll notches — the camera
//! was, in practice, immobile. `pan_speed_for_zoom` and
//! `zoom_speed_for_range` derive both from the atlas's own zoom bounds
//! instead (Task 7 Step 1's "compute it, don't guess" instruction, applied
//! to the two fields the first cut missed), and `clamp_camera_system`
//! re-derives `pan_speed` from the LIVE `zoom_factor` every frame so
//! panning keeps a constant on-screen speed at every zoom level, not just
//! at the opening one. Separately (**F10**, an upstream naming bug this
//! module inherits rather than causes): `run_pancamera_controller` reads
//! `key_zoom_in` and DECREASES `zoom_factor` when it's pressed — but
//! `PanCamera::default()` binds `key_zoom_in` to `+`/`Equal` while ALSO
//! having a forward scroll (the intuitive "zoom in" gesture) decrease
//! `zoom_factor`. Those two defaults contradict each other: with the
//! crate's own defaults, pressing `+` INCREASES `zoom_factor`, i.e. `+`
//! zooms OUT. `spawn_camera` swaps the two keys explicitly below so `+`
//! zooms in and `-` zooms out, matching the scroll wheel's own (already
//! intuitive) direction.
