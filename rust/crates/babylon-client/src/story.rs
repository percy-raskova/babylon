//! The story catalog (B3 wave-1 Task 5, plan
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-b3-null-hypothesis-viewer.md`
//! §2.5/§3.1/§3.2/§3.5): `Story`/`StoryArc`/`MapBinding`/`DeclaredConst` +
//! the two-entry `STORIES` catalog + `--story` CLI selection. This is the
//! single derived roster — `EngineSession::start` (`engine_link.rs`)
//! consumes it, `main.rs`'s `--story <id>` flag selects from it, and
//! `ui/story_card.rs` renders it.
//!
//! **The roster is DERIVED, never hand-transcribed (§2.5 revision 2).**
//! [`roster_from_loaded`] reads a story's own `TERRITORY` nodes back out of
//! `babylon_bsl::scenario::LoadedScenario::node_content_ids` — the loader's
//! own local-name -> `NodeId` inversion — rather than a parallel constant
//! array a content edit could silently drift away from (the old

//! `carceral` (`map_binding: None`) the scenario mints zero `TERRITORY`
//! nodes, so the SAME code path naturally derives an empty roster — no
