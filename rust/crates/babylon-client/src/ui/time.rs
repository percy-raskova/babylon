//! palette COLOR (`heartbeat_color`) onto that same readout without
//! touching anything 2.3 built — kept as two commits so each one's own
//! test rows could go green independently (`tests/time_controls.rs`'s
//! `..._steps_through_three_discrete_palette_colors...` row is the one
//! that stayed red through 2.3 and only 2.4 makes pass).
