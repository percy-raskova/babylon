//! Task 7 of the B3 null-hypothesis-viewer train (plan
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-b3-null-hypothesis-viewer.md`
//! §2.8/§2.9, task-7-brief.md): the carceral arc as the first shipped
//! story, proved three separate ways.
//!
//! - **G1 — the engine-unchanged proof.** A fresh, independent
//!   `TickSession` advanced 110 times, with its own sink, is the REAL
//!   oracle — no blessed constant, computed live in this same test. Its
//!   per-tick `TickReport.after` sequence and final `state_hash` must be
//!   byte-identical to the real client `App`'s own.
//! - **G2 — the drift alarm.** The tick-110 hash, pinned as a `const`
//!   here (never in `babylon-tick` — Global Constraint 6), its value taken
//!   from G1's own independent session.
//! - **G3 — the beat conformance.** Restated over the *rendered feed* what
//!   `babylon-tick/tests/carceral_arc_conformance.rs` asserts about the
//!   engine: the four beats at ticks 1/53/105/106, each exactly once and
//!   four total, `TERMINAL_DECISION`'s numeric GENOCIDE encoding, and the
//!   latch card rendering with the run paused at tick 106 and no verdict
//!   vocabulary on screen (Task 4.5's negative assertion, restated
//!   end-to-end).
//!
//! Plus a text golden (§2.8's third test layer): the rendered beat feed
//! for the whole 110-tick run, byte-for-byte.
//!
//! Headless real `App`, real `KeyboardInput`, virtual time only (I4) — the
//! same house pattern every other test file in this crate uses
//! (`tests/autopause.rs`'s own module doc names it in full).
