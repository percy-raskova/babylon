//! `L` — the state's DOSSIER on a movement (Lane A brick 3; heat dossier
//! §5.1 A).
//!
//! The heat reformulation splits one question-begging `[0,1]` scalar into
//! three quantities with different owners: what the state **knows** (`L`,
//! here), what the state **spends** (`K`, [`crate::capacity`]), and what the
//! movement **is** (`X`, [`crate::exposure`], derived and never stored).
//! Conflating them is what forced the old mechanic to key repression to
//! *conduct* — the ideological falsehood the dossier indicts. Kept apart,
//! nothing needs to ask whether the player broke a law.
//!
//! **A dossier is a projection, not a fraction of the truth.** Scott's five
//! properties of state legibility — interested, documentary, static,
//! aggregate, standardized — mean `L` keeps only what the state's own
//! categories can hold. So this type stores what the state has *resolved*
//! and nothing else: it holds no pointer back to ground truth, and there is
//! deliberately no method that answers "what is really there". Code that
//! wants the truth must ask the substrate; code that wants the state's
//! belief asks a `Dossier`. Those are different questions, and the type
//! system is what keeps them different.
//!
//! **There is no threat score here, and none may be added.** Sparrow's
//! conscious-opponent argument forbids an accumulated priority: an opponent
//! who knows he is being ranked reorganizes, so the ranking must be
//! recomputed from live structure at decision time. `L` records *resolution*
//! — which nodes and ties the state has managed to see — never a verdict
//! about a target. The verdict is [`crate::exposure`] evaluated over
//! [`Dossier::scope`], every time it is asked for.
//!
//! **Growth and decay are not symmetric, and neither is conduct-keyed.**
//! Resolution grows through named collection channels and — Sparrow's
//! feedback loop — fastest where it is already high, because a resolved node
//! exposes its neighbors. It decays through membership turnover,
//! compartmentalization, and restructuring. Both are rules expressed as
//! content (BSL), not arithmetic baked in here; this module supplies only
//! the operations those rules drive.
