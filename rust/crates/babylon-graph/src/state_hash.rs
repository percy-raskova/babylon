//! The graph STATE hash — Constitution III.7's "every tick produces a
//! deterministic hash", for the substrate half.
//!
//! [`babylon_kernel::ContentDigest`] fingerprints what the engine was *told*
//! (defines + rules). This fingerprints what the engine *did*: the graph
//! after a tick. Two runs of the same content over the same starting state
//! must produce the same bytes here, and any real change to the world must
//! change them.
//!
//! # The canonical byte layout — normative
//!
//! This is a **cross-language contract**, so the layout is specified rather
//! than implied by one implementation (the rewrite test: another engine in
//! another language must be able to reproduce these bytes from this
//! description alone). Every integer is **big-endian**. Every string is
//! length-prefixed `u32` + raw UTF-8 bytes, never NUL-terminated.
//!
//! ```text
//! 0x01 ‖ u32 count ‖ per node,      ascending id:   u64 id ‖ str type
//! 0x02 ‖ u32 count ‖ per attribute, ascending (id, name):
//!                                    u64 id ‖ str name ‖ u64 value-bits
//! 0x03 ‖ u32 count ‖ per edge,      ascending (type, from, to):
//!                                    str type ‖ u64 from ‖ u64 to ‖ u64 strength-bits
//! 0x04 ‖ u32 count ‖ per hyperedge, ascending id:
//!                                    u64 id ‖ str type ‖ u32 member-count
//!                                           ‖ u64 member id, ascending
//! 0x05 ‖ u32 count ‖ per edge attribute, ascending (type, from, to, qname):
//!                                    str type ‖ u64 from ‖ u64 to ‖ str qname
//!                                           ‖ u64 value-bits
//! 0x06 ‖ u32 count ‖ per Currency node attribute, ascending (id, name):
//!                                    u64 id ‖ str name ‖ i128 value (16 bytes, big-endian)
//! ```
//!
//! **An edge's strength is NOT an edge attribute.** The `add_edge` operand
//! hashes in section `0x03`; section `0x05` holds every OTHER edge-resident
//! field (the deffield rows ADR198 R1 rules in). A write to
//! `<edge-type>/strength` MUST land in the `0x03` slot, never mint a `0x05`
//! row shadowing it — one datum, one hashed home (the double-storage
//! ruling, D143; `GraphSubstrate::update_edge`'s suffix fork enforces it).
//!
//! **Section `0x06` is a SEPARATE lane from `0x02`, not a widened row
//! shape.** A `currency`-declared node attribute never appears in section
//! `0x02` at all (`babylon-bsl`'s executor routes it through
//! [`crate::substrate::GraphSubstrate::update_node_currency`], never
//! `update_node`) — the two sections partition the node-attribute space by
//! declared type, they do not compete for the same row (T3 #491, OQ-J —
//! Half 2 of the typed-attribute-seeding design). The i128 value is written
//! via `i128::to_be_bytes()` — 16 raw bytes, big-endian — the same "every
//! integer is big-endian" rule this module's other sections hold, extended
//! to 128 bits rather than inventing a second integer convention.
//!
//! # Layout versions
//!
//! The contract is **versioned** (ADR198 R2 ordered the elision rule
//! "documented and versioned"; there was no version anchor before T3, so
//! T3 minted the convention — [`CANONICAL_LAYOUT_VERSION`] carries it in
//! code). The version number is never written into the encoding: the bytes
//! stay self-describing by tag, and a stored hash remains comparable across
//! versions exactly as far as the versions are byte-compatible.
//!
//! - **Version 1** (2026-08-11, the hypergraph storage swap): sections
//!   `0x01`–`0x04`, each written UNCONDITIONALLY — a graph with zero
//!   hyperedges still writes `0x04 ‖ 0x00000000`.
//! - **Version 2** (T3, issue #560, ADR198 R1/R2): section `0x05` — edge
//!   attributes — exists, and is **elided when empty**: a state holding no
//!   edge attributes writes NO `0x05` bytes at all. Consequence: every
//!   version-1 state encodes byte-identically under version 2, so every
//!   existing golden, baseline and save survives the widening unmoved — no
//!   rebless ceremony.
//! - **Version 3** (T3 #491, OQ-J, Currency typed-attribute storage): section
//!   `0x06` — Currency node attributes — exists, and is **elided when
//!   empty**, the same rule `0x05` set as precedent. Every version-2 state
//!   (equivalently, every version-1 state with an empty `0x05`) encodes
//!   byte-identically under version 3: nothing in the tree declares a
//!   `currency`-typed `deffield` yet, so this landing moves zero existing
//!   goldens — the design doc's own recommended shape (conditional
//!   emission over the unconditional variant, chosen exactly so Half 2's
//!   landing PR is byte-free until content opts in). Collision note: the
//!   design doc that specced this train assumed section `0x05` for
//!   Currency; `0x05` was independently claimed by the T3/#560 edge-
//!   attribute widening before this train landed, so Currency takes the
//!   next-free tag, `0x06`, instead — a deviation from the design doc's
//!   literal number, not from its shape.
//!
//! **The deliberate asymmetry, recorded as ADR198 R2's own text
//! orders.** Section `0x04`'s empty section IS written (version-1 behavior,
//! unchanged); sections `0x05`/`0x06`'s are NOT. The conventions genuinely
//! differ and the difference is deliberate: elision is what makes a
//! widening byte-compatible, and retrofitting elision onto `0x04` would
//! itself move every existing hash — the cure would be the disease. Every
//! FUTURE section follows `0x05`/`0x06`'s rule: added at the next tag,
//! elided when empty, so a widening no state yet exercises never moves an
//! existing hash. A change to an EXISTING section's layout is never a
//! version bump; it is a contract change that invalidates every stored
//! state hash and every other implementation (see the pinned byte vectors
//! in this module's tests).
//!
//! **Section tags are not decoration.** Without them a graph with one node
//! and no edges could serialize identically to one with no nodes and one
//! edge under some count arrangement; the tag makes each section's identity
//! explicit.
//!
//! **Sorting is the whole determinism argument.** `MemoryGraph` stores in
//! `HashMap`s, whose iteration order varies per process. Every section sorts
//! before writing, so storage order is unobservable here exactly as it is
//! unobservable through the trait's ranged accessors.
//!
//! # Floats
//!
//! Attribute values and edge strengths are `f64`, and two IEEE-754 facts
//! would otherwise break the contract:
//!
//! - **`-0.0` and `+0.0` compare equal but do not serialize equal.** A sign
//!   bit arriving from upstream arithmetic (`-1.0 * 0.0`) would change the
//!   hash without changing the world. They are canonicalized to `+0.0`.
//! - **NaN is not a value.** It is refused loudly rather than hashed, so a
//!   non-finite can never enter the tick hash and make a run irreproducible.
//!   The write path already refuses non-finites; this is the second gate,
//!   because a hash that silently accepted one would launder it.
//!
//! Finite values are hashed by `to_bits()`, which is exact — no formatting,
//! no rounding, no locale.
