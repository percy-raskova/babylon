//! The `GraphSubstrate` trait: the typed-verb surface BSL's structural
//! effects compile against (`docs/reference/bsl-language.rst` §2.6 queries,
//! §2.8 verbs), independent of the underlying storage.
//!
//! **Two typed halves, one substrate (Amendment D, sub-ruling D-2).** The
//! dyadic half (`add_edge`/`remove_edge`) is II.9's strictly dyadic morphism
//! layer. The hyperedge half (`add_hyperedge`/`remove_hyperedge`/
//! `members_of`/`hyperedges_of`) is Amendment D's first-class membership
//! layer. A dyadic caller cannot be handed a hyperedge and vice versa —
//! II.7's "MUST remain separate" is enforced by the type system rather than
//! by two libraries.
//!
//! **Silent on representation, loud on shape.** No adjacency iteration order
//! and no storage type is exposed; a Levi/incidence bipartite store is
//! permitted and unobservable. What IS exposed, because the ruling fixes it:
//! a hyperedge has an identity and a member list, and there is no method
//! anywhere that expands a member list into pairwise edges (VIII.9).
//!
//! **Task 16 revisions (recorded, not silent):** type/attribute names are
//! `&str` (the drafted `&'static str` forced every runtime-string caller
//! through `Box::leak` — the exact smell the Phase-1 plan's own TODO said
//! not to ship); `add_edge` carries the `:strength` operand §2.8's grammar
//! makes mandatory; and `node_attribute` exists because §2.8's four
//! update-ops (`add`/`sub`/`scale` read-modify-write) are unimplementable
//! without a read point. Attribute values are `f64` — the binary64 lane
//! only; typed attribute storage (Currency's i128 exactness) is a declared
//! Phase-2 gap, not a silent coercion (`babylon-bsl`'s executor rejects
//! Currency-typed writes loudly).
