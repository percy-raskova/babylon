//! The delta document's §8 adapter covenants
//! (`docs/reference/graph-storage-capability-delta.md`), turned into a gate
//! — Phase C Task 9. Covenant 10 observes that the trait cannot enforce its
//! own ordering contract at compile time, so only tests can; this file is
//! where that observation becomes tests rather than discipline.
//!
//! **Coverage note.** Covenants 3 (loud preamble) and 9 (sort on the ruled
//! key, at every ranged accessor) are already exercised, exhaustively, by
//! `run_substrate_conformance(HypergraphStore::new)`
//! (`hypergraph_store.rs`'s own `#[cfg(test)]` module) — duplicating them
//! here would be the same assertions under a different name. This file adds
//! what that suite does not: source-level checks (covenants 1, 2, 6) and
//! HypergraphStore-specific behavioural checks the generic suite has no
//! vocabulary for (4, 5, 8). Covenant 7 (two stores, not one) has no test —
//! see the doc comment at the top of `hypergraph_store.rs`
//! ("Two data structures, not one").
