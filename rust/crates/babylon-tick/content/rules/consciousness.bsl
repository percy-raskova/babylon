; ConsciousnessSystem (Consequences @17.0) — the class-surface measured
; ternary (issue #588, ADR204 W10). Frozen source:
; src/babylon/engine/systems/ideology.py (ConsciousnessSystem, :94-442) with
; the routing law at src/babylon/formulas/consciousness_routing.py:288-370.
; Port posture (the design's own ruling): measured-ternary read path +
; UNPOSITIONED first — transcribe the INPUTS and the ROUTING LAW re-pointed
; at (r, l, f), NOT a cc/ni transcription; the cc/ni bridge mapping is the
; read path's spec, and it lands in a later task.
;
; TASK 1+2+3 SHIP: the NINE-rule pack — `consciousness/p0-position` (the
; class-seeding law, A-001), p1-inbox-reset, p2-org-solidarity-push,
; p3-class-solidarity-push, p4-wage-balance, p5-agitation, p6-route (the
; ADR016 bifurcation law RE-POINTED at the stored ternary — the headliner),
; p7-persist-baselines, and `consciousness/p8-dominant-worldview` (the
; measured readout — the hegemonic tie-break's ONE declared home) — on top
; of the exact qnames consciousness-ternary-conformance.bscn declares. p8
; sorts LAST so the readout reflects the same tick's routing (D116) —
; matching the frozen step's post-update read.
;
; UNPOSITIONED IDIOM (L-ABS, the row-19 disease's death certificate): the
; ternary fields are never defaulted into existence — a never-positioned
; class carries NO r/l/f and NO dominant-worldview, and a raw store read
; errors loud (III.11). Inside a rule, absence is observed ONLY through
; declared literals: `:optional` + `:default 0.0p` bindings, gated on
; `(= (+ r (+ l f)) 0)` — a positioned class is a simplex point (shares sum
; to 1), so a zero sum is EXACTLY never-positioned, by construction, never
; by epsilon and never by a fabricated 0.5 (bindings.rs's own §3.5 law: "no
; rule observes absence — it observes a declared default"). Every later
; rule in this pack optional-binds the ternary the same way and gates on
; `(> (+ r (+ l f)) 0)` for the positive direction.
;
; D116 BYTE-ORDER MAP (docs/reference/bsl-language.rst, the recorded
; cross-rule same-tick visibility divergence this pack deliberately relies
; on, production.bsl-header style): rules run to completion in ascending
; rule-id byte order against the same mutable graph, so the ten rules'
; reads see every earlier rule's same-tick writes. The ordering obligation
; binds every later addition — keep the pN prefixes monotone in the frozen
; engine's own causality order:

;
; D-RECORDS this pack carries (full spike evidence in
; consciousness-ternary-conformance.bscn's header — the two files' records
; are one ledger, split by surface):
;   1. UNPOSITIONED is expressed as `:optional` + `:default 0.0p` + the
;      zero-sum guard (above) — the lawful absence shape in current BSL
;      (no has-field combinator exists; archaeology digest gap 1). The
;      `:default` declarations are deliberate and content-visible;
;      default_lint.rs's allowlist mechanism governs the migration-corpus
;      sites and does not gate this pack's load.
;   2. Anchor presence is tested by SENTINEL, not by a guard combinator:
;      wages-paid / value-produced are non-negative whenever present, so
;      `:default -1` makes `(>= wages 0)` the presence test. An active
;      class with neither anchor (the conformance world's `employer`) is
;      never positioned and never routed.
;   3. ONE-HOME LAW for dominant-worldview (controller ruling 1, fix
;      round): the dominant readout's ONLY writer is
;      consciousness/p8-dominant-worldview (below, landed Task 2) — p0
;      does NOT record dominance at positioning. Task 1 pinned the field
;      ABSENT on a freshly-positioned class as the one-home guard; Task 2
;      flipped that pin to the positive LIBERAL readout (the handoff is
;      recorded in consciousness_ternary_conformance.rs's header), and the
;      absence pins survive only for the genuinely unread
;      (class-unpositioned, employer). History, honestly
;      recorded: this pack's first draft carried a fifth p0 effect
;      writing LIBERAL here, defended as A-001's strict argmax of the
;      rest state; the controller ruled the Task-1 brief's test skeleton
;      had asserted a Task-2 artifact — a plan defect — and the write
;      came OUT. A-001's liberal-default content lives in the (0, 1, 0)
;      positioning itself; the dominance readout is a separate law with
;      its own single home. Task-2 addendum (controller ruling
;      2026-08-15, the Task-2 NEEDS_CONTEXT): the tie-break's strict
;      `< 1e-6` is transcribed verbatim — a decimal-1e-6 gap is NOT a
;      tie (strict `<` excludes the boundary; the conformance world's
;      tv-strict-gap / tv-tie-all-true pair witnesses both arms against
;      the frozen ground truth).
;   4. consciousness/simplex-epsilon has NO defconst row anywhere
;      (controller ruling 4, fix round): the frozen _EPSILON = 1e-10
;      (consciousness_routing.py:41) is inexpressible as a p/i/c literal
;      (E-LEX-023, scale <= 9, reader.rs::classify_unit_interval), so the
;      consuming rule (Task 3) binds it as the expr quotient
;      `(/ 1c 10000000000)` — bit-identical to Python's 1e-10 via one
;      correctly-rounded IEEE-754 division, dodging the lex bound
;      entirely.
;   5. Rounding law (spike 4's verdict; controller ruling 3's verbatim
;      text, the Task-3 conformance mirror's D-row): "no implicit
;      truncation at the store; the int lane holds verbatim f64; `floor`
;      is the content-explicit truncation intrinsic, unused in this
;      pack." The two fix rounds mapped the FULL law: fractional WRITES
;      land verbatim in the int lane, fractional SEEDS are loader-refused
;      (scenario.rs::attribute_value_int, exact error quoted in the
;      scenario header). The fix-round-1 escape — agitation declared
;      `intensity` to admit fractional seeds — was RETIRED by the
;      fix-round-2 ruling: the unit-interval E-EVAL-020 [0,1] ceiling is
;      tick-fatal under the frozen [0,∞) agitation domain — the zero-seed
;      tick-1 undecayed write is already 1.0 (class-bribed), and the
;      accumulator crosses the ceiling at tick 2 (0.9 decayed + 1.0 fresh
;      = 1.9). All three
;      machinery accumulators were therefore int-typed verbatim-f64;
;      agitation seeds at 0 (a produced accumulator, R-MEASURED), the
;      others unseeded until their writing tasks. The verbatim-f64 int
;      lane this row records was RETIRED by Train B item 6
;      (`BslType::Real`): the fields it governed now declare `real`; the
;      store law itself (verbatim f64, no implicit truncation, `floor`
;      available) is unchanged — only the declared home moved.
;   6. The wage flow rides a CLASS-SIDE field (controller ruling 2, fix
;      round): social-class/wages-received carries the per-tick wage
;      inflow as declared content — the frozen engine's incoming-WAGES
;      value_flow fold-sum (ideology.py:299-309) narrows to one declared
;      value per class per tick, exact for single-employer content. The
;      first draft's WAGES edge machinery (three edges + the
;      wages/value-flow edge deffield + social-class/wages-inbox) came
;      OUT: scenario-side edge-attribute seeding is unserved (load_edge
;      is strength-only), a gap recorded for the port train's closing
;      ADR.
;      RETIRED by Train B item 3 (#591, D151's discharge): the WAGES edge
;      machinery described above as having come OUT is back IN —
;      edge-attribute seeding is served (D156's (edge-attr ...) form) and
;      social-class/wages-received is gone; the wage flow now rides the
;      pushed wages-inbox accumulator (consciousness/p2-wages-push). See
;      D151's header row below for the retirement note.
;   7. The `social-class/active` / `organization/active` latches are
;      declared `intensive` here against production-conformance.bscn's and
;      organization-foundation.bscn's `extensive` — a per-node state is
;      never a summed quantity. Kinds are scenario-local; no fold in this
;      pack sums a latch.
;
; REGISTER ROWS this pack landed (docs/reference/bsl-language.rst — full
; text + file:line evidence there; drafted in this header by Task 3, moved
; to the register by Task 4, one line per row here per the production.bsl
; pointer form):
;   D146. The RE-POINTED ACCUMULATOR (the headliner) — the ternary is
;      stored and updated directly; Δl APPLIED; verbatim
;      normalize_to_simplex closure replaces the frozen per-axis clamps.
;   D147. Curve-5 Gaussian NOT transcribed (ADR202 R7); the linear
;      chauvinist pass-through IS (Director flag 2).
;   D148. wage_deterioration stubbed 0.0c (no graph-attr BSL surface).
;   D149. popular_front_suppression stubbed 0.0c (electoral register
;      absent; exact under register-absent content).
;   D150. material_conditions buffer write not ported (no ported
;      consumers).
;   D151. Solidarity pull→push redesign (the D136 fix-round pattern) +
;      the per-pair multi-edge unreachability record (both backends
;      refuse a duplicate (type, from, to) edge), the strength <= 0
;      skip, and the WAGES fold-sum → wages-received narrowing —
;      narrowing retired by Train B item 3 — the wage flow rides seeded
;      WAGES-edge wages/value-flow via push-over-pull; wages-received is
;      gone.
;   D152. Class-source percolation re-pointed at the source's r share.
;   D153. Positioned-only agitation (the anchored ∧ positioned guard).
;   D154. Same-tick closure heal observed (D116; tv-tie-all-true).
;
; "consciousness" is an ALREADY-registered system namespace
; (babylon-tick/src/lib.rs's systems set — the worldview mint's probe
; anchored under it first), so this pack changes no Rust source.

Data-absent classes are never positioned: UNPOSITIONED (L-ABS) — the row-19 disease's death certificate.
