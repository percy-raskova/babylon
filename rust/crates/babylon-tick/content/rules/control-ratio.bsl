; ControlRatioSystem (Material Base @12.0) — the guard:prisoner census and
; its two crisis/terminal-decision branches. Frozen source:
; src/babylon/engine/systems/control_ratio.py (248 lines, one step()).
; Port posture: ADR183 (structure/ordering contract, not a byte oracle) —
; conformance expecteds are measured from THIS engine, never copied from
; the frozen mirror's printed floats (control_ratio_conformance.py's own
; header makes the same point).
;
; TASK 5 SHIPPED `control-ratio/c01-prisoner-census` + `control-ratio/
; c02-publish-census` — the per-node guard/prisoner census and its
; unconditional carrier-side aggregation. TASK 6 SHIPPED `control-ratio/
; c03-crisis` — the readiness gate, the `<=` capacity boundary, and
; BLOCKER-4's guard-split emit. TASK 7 SHIPS `control-ratio/c04-terminal` —
; the ADR070-RESERVED revolution-vs-genocide branch, transcribed VERBATIM
; under the P19 emergent-class-partition cutover (Constitution IX.5 / ADR070
; / Program 19; `control_ratio.py:210-247`, `_emit_terminal_decision`). This
; task touches the Director-reserved line: TRANSCRIBE, do not redesign —
; same threshold source (`carceral/revolution-threshold`), same `>=`
; comparison, same two outcomes, closing this whole pack.
;
; Branched off MERGED `dev` (never stacked on PR A, #193). No `intrinsic`
; declaration in this file — `control-ratio.bsl` never calls `floor` (or
; any other intrinsic); the frozen `ControlRatioSystem` performs no
; truncation anywhere (`_count_enforcer_population`/`_count_prisoner_

; D-RECORDS THIS PACK TRANSCRIBES (full global register row lands as

; obligation this task also discharges — see that row for the census
; find-first -> per-node-aggregate reformulation and its p03 inheritance,
; which is a DECOMPOSITION-side, not a control-ratio-side, fact and so is
; NOT re-stated in this Pack B header. Global D-number cross-references
; added inline below per the final review's I5 finding — this pack's own
; numbering (1-6, 5b) is LOCAL to this file, identical in phrasing to
; decomposition.bsl's own local "D-record N" numbering but NOT the same
; sequence; do not confuse "D-record N" here with register row DN):
;   1. (cited within global D174) THE TWO-ROLE PRISONER SET — the frozen `_PRISONER_ROLES =
;      frozenset({INTERNAL_PROLETARIAT, LUMPENPROLETARIAT})`
;      (`control_ratio.py:32-37`) is TWO roles, not one (unlike
;      Decomposition's single LABOR_ARISTOCRACY target). `c01`'s prisoner
;      gate is `(or (= role SocialRole/INTERNAL_PROLETARIAT) (= role
;      SocialRole/LUMPENPROLETARIAT))` conjoined with `(= active 1)` — the
;      D127 hash-neutral operand-gate idiom, matching `p01`'s own no-`when`
;      shape: every SOCIAL_CLASS subject fires and a non-participant writes
;      zero, keeping the census fresh every tick.
;   2. (global D170) THE UNCONDITIONAL CENSUS PUBLICATION — the frozen `step()` computes
;      the census (`:137-138`) only PAST the readiness gate
;      (`_terminal_decision_emitted` early-return `:124-125`,
;      `_class_decomposition_tick is None` early-return `:128-130`, the
;      delay-elapsed check `:132-134`) — three early returns stand between
;      `step()`'s own entry and its first census read. `c01`/`c02` publish
;      EVERY tick, unconditionally, with no readiness gate of any kind:
;      neither rule reads a single carrier latch. This WIDENS the
;      observable state surface relative to the frozen engine (the carrier
;      now always carries a live, current census, even in ticks/worlds
;      where the frozen engine would never have computed one at all) —
;      `c02_publishes_the_three_aggregates_unconditionally`
;      (`control_ratio_conformance.rs`) proves it directly against an
;      inline NOT-READY world (`decomposition-fired-known 0`).
;      `c02`'s own `institution/decomposition-fire-tick` binding (below)
;      is a SUBJECT-TYPE ANCHOR ONLY, never a gate — `tick.rs::
;      subject_type_of` requires at least one `:field` binding to derive a
;      carrier-anchored rule's subject type (`institution/*` -> INSTITUTION),
;      and `c02` otherwise binds nothing but `nodes`-scoped folds (its
;      three census inputs are all `SOCIAL_CLASS`-scoped, not
;      `INSTITUTION`-scoped), so it has no OTHER institution field to
;      anchor on. Reading it and never using it is the honest shape here,
;      not a design accident. FOLD SCOPE INCLUDES INACTIVE NODES (final
;      review M7, mirroring `decomposition.bsl`'s own note at `:166`,
;      Pack A's Task 1->Task 2 deferred minor, discharged there and never
;      inherited here until now): `c02`'s three `(fold sum (nodes
;      NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS) …)` calls sum over EVERY SOCIAL_CLASS node,
;      active and inactive alike — the fold itself carries no active
;      filter. It is safe only because `c01`'s own `enforcer-gate`/
;      `prisoner-gate` (`item 1 above, both conjoined with `(= active
;      1)`) already zero an inactive node's own three census-contribution
;      fields THIS SAME TICK, ahead of `c02` in byte order (D116) — the
;      fold sums honest zeros, it does not filter them out itself.
;      `c01_publishes_the_two_prisoner_roles_and_the_enforcer_count`
;      (`control_ratio_conformance.rs`) proves both inactive witnesses
;      (`enforcer-inactive`, `prisoner-inactive`) contribute 0 despite
;      nonzero seeded population.
;   3. (no separate global row — a straightforward operator transcription,
;      not a content-model divergence) THE `<=` BOUNDARY (`c03`, LANDED
;      Task 6) — `control_ratio.py:
;      150`'s `if prisoner_pop <= max_controllable: return` (the frozen
;      suite's own `TestControlRatioMutationKillers` class pins this exact
;      operator), transcribed verbatim as `(> prisoner-population
;      max-controllable)` in `c03`'s own `when` conjunction (the logical
;      negation of the frozen early-return, since `when` states the
;      continue-condition rather than the return-condition).
;      `control-ratio-within-capacity-conformance.bscn` seeds the boundary
;      EXACTLY (prisoner population 40 == enforcer population 10 *
;      `carceral/control-capacity` 4) — `c03_does_not_emit_at_or_below_
;      capacity` (`control_ratio_conformance.rs`) is the mutation killer: a
;      `<=` -> `<` transcription error (i.e. flipping this `when` conjunct
;      from `>` to `>=`) flips it red.
;   4. (global D171 item 4) THE GUARD-SPLIT EMIT (`c03`, LANDED Task 6, BLOCKER-4) —
;      `float("inf")` (`control_ratio.py:185`'s zero-enforcer branch) and
;      `x/0` are both unrepresentable in BSL (`E-EVAL-014`/`E-EVAL-012`).
;      `control-ratio-zero-enforcer-conformance.bscn` seeds a REAL, active,
;      zero-population CARCERAL_ENFORCER class (not an absent one), and
;      `c03` guard-splits its emit in TWO independent ways to survive it:
;      (a) the `actual-ratio` BINDING itself is protected by an internal
;      `(if (= enforcer-population 0) (- 0 0c) (/ prisoner-population
;      enforcer-population)) …` — required because `:expr` bindings
;      evaluate unconditionally every tick this rule's one INSTITUTION
;      subject is visited, regardless of `when`/`guard`
;      (fixed forward, final review I4 — the citation below was wrong: this
;      lives in Pack A's TEST file, not `decomposition.bsl` itself —
;      `decomposition_conformance.rs:172-176`'s own "Retraction (fix round
;      1, PR review)" paragraph: "every `:expr` binding … evaluates
;      eagerly and unconditionally, once per subject per tick, regardless
;      of what any later binding or guard does") — an UNPROTECTED division would
;      abort EVERY tick of the zero-enforcer world with `E-EVAL-012`, not
;      merely the crisis tick; (b) the EFFECTS themselves guard-split via
;      two `(guard (> enforcer-population 0) …)` / `(guard (=
;      enforcer-population 0) …)` forms, selecting which payload the
;      emitted event actually carries: the ratio keys
;      (`actual-ratio`/`control-ratio`) when `enforcer-population > 0`, the
;      SAME payload MINUS those two keys when `enforcer-population == 0` —
;      loud absence, not a fabricated number. Mutation evidence
;      (`c03_omits_the_ratio_keys_when_there_are_no_enforcers` plus the
;      dedicated mutation exercise recorded in this commit's own message):
;      dropping mechanism (a)'s `if`-protector (not merely (b)'s
;      guard-split) is what reproduces the frozen `float("inf")`
;      unrepresentability as a NAMED `E-EVAL-012` test failure rather than
;      a silent no-emit.
;   5. (global D171 item 3; also D174's own RESERVED-LINE subject) THE
;      NUMERIC `outcome` ENCODING (`c04`, LANDED Task 7, ADR070/
;      BLOCKER-5) — `emit` carries no string payload values at all (`Str`
;      has no `<payload-item>` production); the frozen `outcome` string
;      ("revolution"/"genocide", `control_ratio.py:222,228`) becomes a
;      numeric `(outcome 1)` = revolution / `(outcome 0)` = genocide, with
;      `narrative_hint` dropped (the same class of omission as
;      Decomposition's own D-record 5). `control-ratio-conformance.bscn`
;      (organization 0.2, genocide) and `control-ratio-revolution-
;      conformance.bscn` (organization 0.6, revolution) make the mapping
;      mutation-provable. Payload key order transcribed verbatim from
;      `:239-245`: `outcome`, `avg_organization`, `revolution_threshold`,
;      `prisoner_population`, `enforcer_population` (`narrative_hint`
;      dropped, five keys not six). THE RESERVED BRANCH ITSELF (`:222,228`):
;      `avg_organization >= revolution_threshold` -> REVOLUTION, else ->
;      GENOCIDE — transcribed as the SAME `>=` comparison against the SAME
;      `carceral/revolution-threshold` source, two `guard`-split emits
;      differing ONLY in the numeric `outcome`, per the Director-reserved-
;      line discipline (Constitution IX.5 / ADR070 / Program 19; this
;      train's own RESERVED LINE global constraint: transcribe verbatim
;      under a P19-cutover-pending D-record; any change to WHICH
;      organization measure decides, or to the partition the roles come
;      from, escalates to the Director — this port changes neither).
;      `avg-organization`'s own division-by-zero protector (`(if (=
;      prisoner-population 0) (- 0 0c) (/ prisoner-org-weighted
;      prisoner-population))`) is ALSO a verbatim transcription, not a new
;      defensive measure: `control_ratio.py:171`'s own `avg_organization =
;      prisoner_org_sum / prisoner_pop if prisoner_pop > 0 else 0.0` carries
;      the identical ternary — BLOCKER-4's "`:expr` bindings evaluate
;      eagerly every tick regardless of `when`/`guard`" mechanism (c03's own
;      precedent) is why it must be an explicit `if`, not a bare `/`, in
;      BSL specifically (the frozen ternary is provably dead code within its
;      OWN single `step()` call — c04's carrier-anchored per-tick evaluation
;      is the general reason a future world COULD reach the zero branch).
;      DISCHARGED (final review I2's round-2 gate restoration, checked
;      directly by mutation exercise): the ORIGINAL claim here — that none
;      of this pack's fixtures ever reaches `prisoner-population == 0` at a
;      tick `c04` evaluates — no longer holds now that `when` itself gates
;      on `prisoner-population > 0` (D-record 5b below).
;      `c04_does_not_emit_when_the_terminal_tick_census_has_zero_prisoners`
;      (`control_ratio_conformance.rs`) seeds exactly that world; `:expr`
;      bindings evaluate eagerly regardless of `when` (BLOCKER-4's own
;      mechanism), so `avg-organization`'s protected ternary IS evaluated
;      for that fixture even though `when` refuses the emit. Replacing the
;      protector with a bare `(/ prisoner-org-weighted prisoner-population)`
;      now aborts THAT fixture's own `run()` call with a NAMED
;      `E-EVAL-012`, not a silent pass — mutation-provable like `c03`'s own
;      BLOCKER-4 protector, restored byte-identical after the exercise.
;   5b. THE ROUND-2 GATE RESTORATION (final review I2 / D174 addendum) —
;      the frozen `step()` is ONE function re-executed from the top on
;      every call, so TWO more early returns guard the terminal emit,
;      re-evaluated on the terminal tick against the FRESH same-tick
;      census: `if prisoner_pop == 0: return` (`:141-142`) and `if
;      prisoner_pop <= max_controllable: return` (`:150-151`, D-record 3's
;      SAME `<=` boundary). `c04`'s original `when` (Task 7) transcribed
;      only the readiness/latch gates and dropped these two, unrecorded —
;      at `prisoner-population == 0` it would have emitted a spurious
;      GENOCIDE (the protector above yields `avg-organization = 0.0 <
;      0.5`). Restored as two added `when` conjuncts —
;      `(> prisoner-population 0)` and `(> prisoner-population
;      max-controllable)`, `max-controllable = enforcer-population *
;      control-capacity` (a new `:const`/`:expr` binding pair) — proven by
;      `c04_does_not_emit_when_the_terminal_tick_census_has_zero_
;      prisoners` and `c04_does_not_emit_when_the_terminal_tick_census_
;      falls_back_within_capacity` (`control_ratio_conformance.rs`), both
;      mutation-killed by reverting `when` to its pre-round-2 shape.
;      E-LEX-026 HEADROOM (final review M1, remeasured post-round-2):
;      `c04`'s `:material-basis` quoted string is **981 bytes** (no
;      non-ASCII, no escapes, so char count = byte count), against
;      E-LEX-026's **1024**-byte cap (`bsl-language.rst:467`,
;      `reader.rs:175`) — **43 bytes of headroom**, down from the
;      pre-round-2 974/1024 (50 headroom) the string was already
;      compressed to once before. `c03`'s own string is now the
;      TIGHTEST in this pack at 987/1024 (37 headroom). Recorded here so
;      the next editor adding a clause to either string sees the E-LEX-026
;      pressure coming instead of hitting a whole-load lexer refusal cold.
;   6. (global D172, HISTORICAL; superseded by ADR222/PER-17) THE FORMER
;      CROSS-PACK BYTE-ORDER INVERSION — `control-ratio/*` formerly sorted
;      BEFORE `decomposition/*` in ascending rule-id byte order (D100's
;      class, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-decomposition-
;      controlratio-port.md` §5), inverting the frozen @11.0-then-@12.0
;      system order. It was benign BY CONSTRUCTION, not by luck: every one
;      of this whole Pack B's four scenarios SEEDS
;      `decomposition-fire-tick`/`-fired-known`/`decomposition-complete`
;      directly rather than relying on a co-loaded `decomposition/*`
;      pack to write them the same tick — the "post-decomposition carrier
;      state" design each scenario's own header states. The authoring
;      constraint this seeding discipline exists to satisfy: NO Pack B
;      scenario may set `carceral/control-ratio-delay` to 0 while ALSO
;      relying on `decomposition-fire-tick` being written BY
;      `decomposition/p03-trigger` that same tick — every scenario in
;      this pack seeds it instead, so the hazard never engages. (The
;      executable form of this constraint — a co-loaded-pack test proving
;      an UNSEEDED zero-delay world does NOT crisis on the firing tick —
;      is Task 8's `carceral-arc-conformance` scope, not this pack's own
;      scenarios, none of which co-load `decomposition/*` at all.)
