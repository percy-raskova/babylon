; DecompositionSystem (Material Base @11.0) — the terminal crisis that splits
; the Labor Aristocracy into carceral enforcers and internal proletariat when
; super-wages can no longer be paid. Frozen source:
; src/babylon/engine/systems/decomposition.py (370 lines, one step()).
; Port posture: ADR183 (structure/ordering contract, not a byte oracle) —
; conformance expecteds are measured from THIS engine, never copied from the
; frozen mirror's printed floats (decomposition_conformance.py's own header
; makes the same point for its persistent_data dump).
;
; TASK 2 SHIP: `decomposition/p01-la-census` + `decomposition/p02-superwage-
; warning` — the per-node LA census publication and the early-warning latch.
; TASK 3 SHIP: `decomposition/p03-trigger` — the carrier-side trigger and the
; frozen transfer-amount arithmetic. TASK 4 SHIP: `decomposition/p04-
; enforcer-intake` + `decomposition/p05-ip-intake` + `decomposition/p06-la-
; deactivate` — the two intake rules and the LA deactivation, closing Pack A.
;
; `(intrinsic floor :params (real) :returns int :cost 5)` is declared here
; (Pack A) — `p03-trigger` (Task 3) is the first caller (`(floor (*
; la-population enforcer-fraction))` etc); p01 and p02 never call it.
; CORRECTED (final review I1 — this header previously claimed the
; declaration "lives in exactly one file", which is FALSE):
; `territory.bsl:67` ALREADY declares a BYTE-IDENTICAL `(intrinsic floor
; :params (real) :returns int :cost 5)`, and
; `babylon-bsl/src/declarations.rs:1010-1017` (`parse_intrinsic_decls`)
; refuses a duplicate declaration BY NAME ONLY — `if
; decls.contains_key(&decl.name)` — with NO content comparison, so two
; BYTE-IDENTICAL declarations refuse just as hard as two conflicting ones.
; The REAL constraint: the `floor` intrinsic is declared PER-FILE (not
; deduplicated across files), the loader refuses a duplicate name
; unconditionally, and Territory @3.0 + Decomposition @11.0 are both
; Material Base systems — so ANY content set that co-loads
; `decomposition.bsl` with `territory.bsl` dies at load with
; `E-LOAD-001`, a landmine on the Checkpoint A path (all 13 Material Base
; systems loaded together). No content set does this today (`floor_
; intrinsic_e2e.rs:137-138`'s test proves the REFUSAL mechanism, not an
; exemption from it) — checked directly: `load_scenario_with_prelude`
; (the ONLY prelude mechanism in this estate, ADR209) operates on
; SCENARIO-side declarations (`defenum`/`deffield`/`defconst` via
; `EnumRegistry::declare`'s identical-recognition arm, `scenario.rs`) and
; has NO counterpart for RULE-file `intrinsic` declarations at all —
; `split_content`/`declarations.rs`'s intrinsic-parsing path is a
; completely separate, prelude-unaware load path. A dedup/prelude rule
; for rule-file intrinsics does not exist yet; until one lands, packs
; declaring `floor` must never co-load in one content set. Follow-up
; filed: **#646** (final review I1, Checkpoint A implication).
;
; D116 BYTE-ORDER MAP (docs/reference/bsl-language.rst) — rules run to

;
; D-RECORDS this pack transcribes (full register rows D166-D174 landed in
; Task 9, global-D-number cross-references added inline below per the
; final review's I5 finding; D165 alone landed in Task 5, per that row's
; own text — it lives in this file's p01/p03 :material-basis prose, not
; in the numbered list below). production.bsl/consciousness.bsl's own
; header-first convention followed here — the file is the record, the
; register catalogs it):
;   1. (global D166) THE CARRIER REFORMULATION — the frozen `persistent_data` dict
;      (`_superwage_crisis_tick`, `_decomposition_complete`,
;      `_class_decomposition_tick`, …) becomes `institution/*` fields on the
;      single `carceral-register` carrier (plan §2). Every `None`-sentinel
;      the frozen dict carries becomes a companion `*-known` int 0/1 flag
;      (III.11 loud-absence encoding) rather than a magic sentinel value,
;      since no `:optional`/`:default` route exists for a `.bscn`-seeded
;      field. Reads reach the carrier via `(field-of (select-max (nodes
;      NodeType/INSTITUTION) 1) institution/…)`; writes via `(update-node
;      (select-max (nodes NodeType/INSTITUTION) 1) institution/… (set …))`
;      — the D103/D104 accumulate-into-a-non-self-target lane.
;   2. (global D167) THE OMITTED `add-node` BRANCH — `_create_target_entity`/spec-071's
;      create-on-demand path (`decomposition.py:225-261`, `_ENFORCER_ID_
;      OFFSET`/`_INTERNAL_PROLETARIAT_ID_OFFSET`) is OMITTED entirely:
;      `add-node` is refused at content load (`DEFERRED_SHAPE_VERBS`,
;      `structural_verbs.rs`), so every conformance world pre-seeds its own
;      CARCERAL_ENFORCER/INTERNAL_PROLETARIAT targets instead (already
;      recorded as BLOCKER-1 in `decomposition-conformance.bscn`'s header);
;      p04/p05 read/write the pre-seeded nodes and never create one.
;   3. (global D168) THE OMITTED HISTORY READ — the frozen engine's `services.event_bus.
;      get_history()` scan for `SUPERWAGE_CRISIS` events
;      (`decomposition.py:164-175`), which recovers `_superwage_crisis_tick`
;      from event history on a tick where `persistent_data` alone lost it,
;      is OMITTED: BSL has no same-tick or cross-tick event-history query
;      (`bsl-language.rst`'s own gap item 3 — "the emitting rule also stamps
;      a field" is the prescribed re-modelling). The carrier's
;      `superwage-crisis-known`/`-tick` latch, written by p02 the same tick
;      it emits, is the sole source of truth — exactly the re-modelling the
;      language document itself names, not an invented shortcut.
;   4. (global D171 item 1) THE PAYLOAD FLATTENING — `SUPERWAGE_CRISIS`'s frozen payload carries
;      `payer_id` (a second NodeRef, always `CORE_BOURGEOISIE_ID`) and
;      `narrative_hint` (a string) that this port DROPS (item 5 below);
;      `CLASS_DECOMPOSITION`'s frozen payload nests `population_transferred`/
;      `wealth_transferred` as sub-dicts (`decomposition.py:352-359`) that
;      p06 flattens to four top-level numeric keys
;      (`population-transferred-to-enforcer`/`-to-proletariat`,
;      `wealth-transferred-to-enforcer`/`-to-proletariat`), since
;      `<payload-item>` values are flat `<expr>` (number/bool/enum-ref/
;      NodeRef) — no dict, no string.
;   5. (global D171 item 2) THE DROPPED NARRATIVE HINTS AND `trigger_event` — every
;      `narrative_hint` string (`decomposition.py:189-192`, `361-365`) AND
;      `CLASS_DECOMPOSITION`'s `trigger_event` string
;      (`decomposition.py:360`, always `"superwage_crisis"`) are OMITTED
;      from every emitted payload: `emit` carries no string payloads at all
;      (`Str` has no `<payload-item>` production, `bsl-language.rst`'s gap
;      item 4) — `trigger_event` is the same class of omission as
;      `narrative_hint`, not a separate divergence, since BSL's `p03`-`p06`
;      chain already makes the trigger unambiguous through the carrier's
;      own `fire-tick` latch (D-record 3, global D168).
;   6. D116 BYTE-ORDER RELIANCE — the map above; p02 reads p01's
;      `la-approaching-flag` write from THIS tick, p03 reads p01's/p02's
;      SAME-TICK carrier writes, and p04-p06 each read p03's this-tick
;      carrier write in turn.
;   7. (global D173 item 4) THE BARE-`2` LITERAL — `carceral/approaching-consumption-multiple`
;      (defconst value `2`) has NO `CarceralDefines` backing anywhere in the
;      frozen source: it is a bare `2 * consumption` literal at
;      `decomposition.py:155` (`_APPROACHING_CONSUMPTION_MULTIPLE`-shaped,
;      never named as a define). Transcription note, not an escalation
;      (already recorded in the Global Constraints table and the scenario's
;      own header). Task 2 mutation evidence (Step 6): flipping this
;      scenario constant 2 -> 1 (narrowing the approaching-bound from 520 to
;      510) flips NO Task 2 test — `la-dying`'s wealth (400) sits below BOTH
;      bounds, so the multiplier is load-bearing content this fixture does
;      not witness. Predicted by the plan itself; DISCHARGED by Task 4's
;      delay scenario (`decomposition-delay-conformance.bscn`'s
;      `la-approaching`, wealth 515 strictly between subsistence + 1x
;      consumption (510) and subsistence + 2x consumption (520)) — flipping
;      2 -> 1 there makes `la-approaching-flag` stay 0 forever, so
;      SUPERWAGE_CRISIS never fires and the delay path never reaches
;      CLASS_DECOMPOSITION, flipping
;      `the_delay_path_emits_the_warning_at_tick_1_and_decomposes_at_tick_53`
;      red.
;   8. (global D173 item 1) DOCSTRING DRIFT — the module docstring (`decomposition.py:4-5`) claims
;      "30% of Labor Aristocracy becomes CARCERAL_ENFORCER" / "70% falls into
;      INTERNAL_PROLETARIAT", but the CODE reads the split from
;      `CarceralDefines` (`enforcer_fraction = 0.15`, `proletariat_fraction =
;      0.85`, `defines.yaml:295-296`) — 15%/85%, not 30%/70%. ADR183: the
;      code is the port's oracle, not its own docstring; transcribed as
;      15%/85% exactly, the drift noted here rather than "corrected" in
;      either direction.
;   9. (global D173 item 3) NON-CONSERVATION — `enforcer_pop_gain = int(la_population *
;      enforcer_fraction)` and `proletariat_pop = int(la_population *
;      proletariat_fraction)` (`decomposition.py:298-299`) truncate
;      INDEPENDENTLY; for an `la_population` not evenly split by 0.15/0.85
;      their sum can be STRICTLY LESS than `la_population` (population is
;      lost, never gained, since both operations floor). A real defect in
;      the frozen engine, transcribed verbatim by Task 3's `p03-trigger`
;      (which computes both amounts with the same two independent floors).
;      This train's own fixture (`la-dying`, population 1000) happens to
;      split exactly (150 + 850 = 1000) and does not witness the loss —
;      noted here as inherited-defect transcription, not proven by this
;      world.
;
; TASK 4 DISCHARGED MUTATION OBLIGATIONS (carried from Tasks 2/3 reviews,
; not separate D-records — both gates were already correctly transcribed,
; only unwitnessed by the fixtures that existed at the time):
;   10. `p03-trigger`'s `(> la-population 0)` conjunct (`decomposition.py:
;       290-291`'s early return): Task 3's own mutation evidence found NO
;       test flips `>` -> `>=` because that fixture's folded la-population
;       is always 1000, never zero. DISCHARGED by a dedicated inline
;       zero-population world (`decomposition_conformance.rs`'s
;       `p03_gate_blocks_zero_population_la_even_when_the_delay_has_elapsed`)
;       — a single LA node seeded with population 0 and the carrier's
;       `superwage-crisis-known`/`-tick` SEEDED directly (bypassing p02
;       entirely, since a population-0 LA's own approaching/dying flags can
;       never go non-zero — p01's flags read `population` verbatim, not
;       through the census fold), so `delay-elapsed-fire` is true from tick
;       1 while folded la-population stays 0 for the life of the world —
;       isolated from every other fixture's non-zero LA population (the
;       fold is global over ALL SOCIAL_CLASS nodes, so this could not share
;       a world with the delay scenario's own `la-approaching`).
;   11. `p01-la-census`'s `(= active 1)` conjunct: no existing fixture
;       (Tasks 2-3) seeded an INACTIVE Labor Aristocracy node, so nothing
;       proved the active gate load-bearing on its own (only the role gate
;       was mutation-tested, Task 2's commit). DISCHARGED by
;       `decomposition-delay-conformance.bscn`'s `la-inactive` (active 0,
;       wealth 1 < its own subsistence 500 — would flag dying if the active
;       conjunct were dropped) — mirrors `production-conformance.bscn:161-
;       166`'s `worker-la-idle` vector.
;
; p01's OWN transcription note (not a divergence, so no numbered row above):
; the frozen `la_approaching_death`/`la_about_to_die` gates both carry a
; `la_pop > 0` conjunct alongside the wealth comparison
; (`decomposition.py:155,158`) — preserved verbatim in p01's nested `if`
; below, even though every fixture in this train's conformance world seeds a
; strictly positive LA population.
