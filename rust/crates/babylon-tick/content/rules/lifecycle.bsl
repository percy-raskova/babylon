; LifecycleSystem (Material Base @7.0) — the D-P-D' circuit.
;
; Every county cycles population through three phases every tick: D
; (pre-productive, raised out of household/community labor), P (productive,
; sells labor-power), D' (post-productive, lives on the legitimation
; bargain — pensions, Social Security, home equity, the promise that a
; lifetime of production earns a floor under old age). The circuit computes
; population flow between the phases, the index that measures how credibly
; the D' promise is underwritten, and the ideology a new P-phase cohort
; inherits from its caregivers and its institutions.
;
; THIS PACK PORTS THREE OF THE FROZEN SYSTEM'S FIVE FLAT RULES (the R8 gap
; analysis's own count, reports/bsl-gap-analysis-2026-08-10.md row 7.0):
; DPD population flow, the legitimation index (+ crisis/recovery detection),
; and ideology transmission. Two do NOT land — inheritance flow and class
; mobility — for ONE shared reason, recorded precisely in WHAT DOES NOT LAND
; below. Both blocked rules are confirmed dead ends on the canonical graph
; today (grep-verified against dev tip 6c33b42c): `adjusted_p_to_d_prime`
; and `differential_p_to_d_prime` are read by no other system, and inheritance
; flow's only consumer is chronicle narration off an event, never simulation
; state (`LifecycleSystem.step()` calls no `graph.update_node` for the
; inheritance amounts at all — it is event-emission only). The three ported
; rules carry the system's load-bearing output: `legitimation_index` feeds
; `domain/bifurcation/analysis.py`, `engine/systems/struggle.py` and
; `engine/systems/electoral.py` directly.
;
; ============================================================================
; WHAT DOES NOT LAND, AND EXACTLY WHY
; ============================================================================
;
; `pareto_alpha` (inheritance Gini), `early_mortality_modifier` and
; `carceral_transition_modifier` (class mobility) are runtime-moddable
; LifecycleDefines coefficients whose declared domain is `(0, 10]` /
; `[0, 10]` — `src/babylon/data/defines.yaml:528,533,534`, each comment
; self-documenting the overflow ("Fed SCF... (> 0.0, <= 10.0)", "Chetty...
; (>= 0.0, <= 10.0)" twice). `bsl-language.rst` §1.5 caps every non-Currency
; scaled literal at `[0.0, 1.0]` (the `p`/`i`/`c` suffixes) and §3.1 declares
; "no coercions" — there is no legal `defconst` for a value like `1.5`,
; `2.8` or `1.24` that is not itself a dollar amount (`$`, which is also
; wrong: `Currency`'s own operator table, §3.2, admits no `Currency ×
; Currency`, so two such moddables could not even combine). This is the
; SAME construct gap the Territory BSL assessment (2026-08-11) named
; Blocker-1 and put behind director-gate #492: a runtime-moddable define
; with domain beyond `[0,1]` has no BSL representation today, full stop —
; not "multiplies Currency" specifically, "cannot be written at all"
; generally. Rounding `pareto_alpha` to the nearest int-storable value would
; not dodge the gap; it would silently change `compute_pareto_gini`'s
; output by construction (`1/(2·1.5−1) = 0.5` vs `1/(2·1−1) = 1.0`), which
; the port-as-is directive and the no-silent-degradation standard both
; forbid. Per §6 of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-10-vitality-bsl-rule-
; pack.md`, this port transcribes no formula and invents no substitute —
; it waits on #492's resolution, same as Territory.
;
; What that blocks precisely:
;   - `DefaultInheritanceCalculator.compute_inheritance_flow` (`domain/
;     economics/lifecycle/inheritance.py:108-140`) — `compute_pareto_gini`
;     needs `pareto_alpha`. Blocks the `INHERITANCE_TRANSFER` event only;
;     the frozen system writes no graph state from this branch at all.
;   - `DefaultClassMobilityCalculator.compute_premature_exit_rate` and
;     `DefaultCohortDynamicsCalculator.apply_differential_rates` (system
;     Steps 6-7) — both read `early_mortality_modifier`/
;     `carceral_transition_modifier` off `ClassMobilityParams`. Blocks
;     `adjusted_p_to_d_prime` and `differential_p_to_d_prime`, confirmed
;     dead-end fields (see header).
;
; ============================================================================
; MODELING CHOICE — D-1: the five constant-in-practice inputs become `:const`
; ============================================================================
;
; `LegitimationState`'s five components (`pension_coverage`,
; `ss_replacement_rate`, `healthcare_security`, `home_ownership_rate`,
; `retirement_confidence`) and `DPDState`'s four rate fields (`rate_d_to_p`,
; `rate_p_to_d_prime`, `rate_d_prime_to_death`, `birth_rate`) are read
; per-node-with-defines-fallback in the frozen Python
; (`LifecycleSystem._read_legitimation_state`, `LifecycleSystem.step` lines
; 85-102). But nothing else in the tree ever writes divergent per-territory
; values for any of these nine fields (grep-verified: `legitimation_state`,
; `caregiver_ideology`, `institutional_hegemony`, `community_tendency` and
; `mobility_params` are written ONLY by `LifecycleSystem` itself, and
; `compute_transitions`/`apply_differential_rates` always echo the DPDState
; rate fields back unchanged) — so on tick 1 EVERY territory falls into the
; "initialize from defines" branch, and every tick after that reads back the
; SAME defines-derived value it started with. The per-node storage never
; observably diverges from "read the global constant" in the shipped
; engine. This pack transcribes the OBSERVABLE behavior — one value, shared
; by every territory — as `:const` bindings, which is also the only legal
; move: `bsl-language.rst`'s known constraint that "the slice-1 scenario
; loader seeds ONLY int-declared node attributes" (`scenario.rs::
; attribute_value`) refuses a fractional per-node seed outright, and these
; nine values are fractional by nature. If per-county legitimation or rate
; data is ever wired for real (it is not today — a genuine gap, independent
; of this port), that is new content work, not a retrofit of this rule.
; Mirrors D-2's dead-branch reasoning in the Vitality plan.
;
; `caregiver_ideology` and `institutional_hegemony` are a sharper case of
; the same thing: they are not even `LifecycleDefines` fields. Python reads
; them with a bare inline default of `0.5` (`engine/systems/lifecycle.py:
; 191-192`) that no `defines.yaml` entry backs, and — per the same grep —
; nothing ever writes them either, so they are permanently `0.5` in the
; shipped engine. Recorded as **D-2**: a modding-contract gap in the frozen
; engine (the same class as Vitality's D-3), transcribed as `:const`
; bindings this pack names `lifecycle/caregiver-ideology-default` and
; `lifecycle/institutional-hegemony-default` rather than reading a
; `defines.yaml` line that does not exist. `community_tendency` is always
; absent in production (nothing writes it, confirmed by the same grep), so
; its amplification term (`cohort_dynamics.py:214-215`) is a dead branch
; and this pack drops it — recorded as **D-3**, mirroring the Vitality
; plan's D-2.
;
; ============================================================================
; §5.4 DEFECT REPAIR — D-5: the crisis/recovery edge check is case-broken
; ============================================================================
;
; `engine/systems/lifecycle.py:146,157` compares `prev_crisis` — read off
; the graph, holding whatever a PRIOR tick wrote via `crisis_class.value`
; — against the LITERAL string `"CRISIS"`. But
; `LegitimationClassification` is a `StrEnum` whose values are lowercase
; (`models/enums/legal.py:24-26`: `CRISIS = "crisis"`), so `prev_crisis`
; is always `"crisis"`, `"unstable"`, `"stable"` or `None` — **never**
; `"CRISIS"`. Concretely: `prev_crisis != "CRISIS"` is true on every tick
; regardless of the actual previous state, so `LEGITIMATION_CRISIS` fires
; EVERY tick a territory classifies CRISIS rather than only on the
; transition into it; and `prev_crisis == "CRISIS"` is false on every
; tick, so `LEGITIMATION_RECOVERY` is permanently dead code. No test in
; the frozen estate exercises either branch
; (`rg LEGITIMATION_CRISIS|LEGITIMATION_RECOVERY tests/integration/
; test_lifecycle_system.py` — no hits), which is how this went unnoticed.
;
; This pack's crisis classification has no string-case axis to inherit the
; bug through — `LegitimationClassification` has no BSL representation
; (see Block 2 below), so it is encoded as an `int` this pack controls
; both ends of. Writing the SAME case-mismatch bug back in would mean
; deliberately comparing the int encoding against the wrong constant on
; purpose, which is unauditable nonsense, not a transcription. **Repair:**
; this pack implements genuinely edge-triggered semantics — `!= 2` vs `= 2`
; where both sides share one encoding — which is what the frozen code's
; own structure and comment ("Emit crisis/recovery events") plainly
; intend. This is a real, deliberate behavioral difference from the
; frozen engine for the TWO EVENT TYPES ONLY; every state field this pack
; writes (`legitimation-index`, `legitimation-crisis` itself, and
; everything Blocks 1/3 touch) is unaffected and matches the frozen engine
; exactly. The conformance test asserts the correct edge-triggered firing
; pattern rather than replaying the frozen engine's buggy event log for
; these two event types — see `lifecycle_conformance.rs`'s header for the
; exact vectors on both sides.
;
; ============================================================================
; MODELING CHOICE — D-4: three saturating clamps are provably redundant
; ============================================================================
;
; Three places the frozen Python defensively clamps a value this pack
; leaves unclamped, because the clamp cannot fire given the declared
; domains of its own inputs (all rates/fractions here are `[0,1]`-bounded
; `c`-literals, checked at LOAD by `bsl-language.rst` §1.5's `E-LEX-024`,
; and every population/wealth field is non-negative by construction):
;
;   1. `compute_population_flow`'s three `max(0.0, …)` calls
;      (`formulas/lifecycle.py:57-59`). `d_to_p = rate_d_to_p × pop_d` with
;      `rate_d_to_p ∈ [0,1]` gives `d_to_p ≤ pop_d`, so
;      `(pop_d + births) − d_to_p ≥ births ≥ 0` always — same argument for
;      the other two. §3.10's rider slate declines a scalar min/max
;      operator precisely so a saturation stays legible in the source
;      (the reason Vitality's plan gives for spelling its own clamp as an
;      `if`); here there is nothing to spell, because the saturation never
;      triggers.
;   2. `wealth_d_prime`'s `surviving_fraction = max(0.0, 1.0 − deaths /
;      old_total)` (`cohort_dynamics.py:151`) — `deaths ≤ old_total` by the
;      same rate-bound argument, so the fraction is always in `[0,1]`.
;   3. `compute_legitimation_index`'s `max(0.0, min(1.0, index))`
;      (`formulas/lifecycle.py:140`) — the five `legit_w_*` weights sum to
;      exactly `1.0` at their current `defines.yaml` values (`0.35 + 0.30 +
;      0.20 + 0.10 + 0.05`), and each component is a `[0,1]`-bounded `c`
;      literal, so the weighted sum is a convex combination and cannot
;      leave `[0,1]`.
;
; Recorded honestly: this is a fact about the CURRENT `defines.yaml`
; values, not a law the type system enforces. A mod that changes the
; `legit_w_*` weights to no longer sum to `1.0`, or a modder editing the
; rate defines to something the `c`-literal load-time check would still
; accept, could in principle break case 3 (case 1/2 hold for ANY `[0,1]`
; rate, so they are safe under any legal mod). Python's `max`/`min` would
; silently absorb that; this pack's `int`-declared output fields carry no
; automatic range check at all (§3.3's store-boundary check is specific to
; `Probability`/`Coefficient`/`Intensity`-declared fields, and every
; per-node field in this pack is `int` per the seeding constraint above),
; so an out-of-range legitimation index would silently store instead of
; failing loudly. This is a modding-contract gap inherited from the
; int-workaround every slice-1 rule pack needs, not introduced by this
; port — recorded so a later reader does not have to re-derive it.
;
; ideology transmission's own clamp (`cohort_dynamics.py:217`,
; `max(0.0, min(1.0, raw))`) is redundant by the identical convex-
; combination argument: `caregiver_weight + institutional_weight = 1.0`
; (`0.7 + 0.3`) blends two `[0,1]` inputs, and the regression step
; `raw·(1−r) + 0.5·r` blends `raw` (now proven `[0,1]`) with the constant
; `0.5` by weights that also sum to `1.0`.
;
; verify_conservation (system Step 2) only calls `logger.warning` — no
; graph write, no event. BSL's eight structural verbs (§2.8) include no
; logging verb, so this step has no BSL transcription and is dropped
; without a behavioral difference (nothing it does is observable).
;
; ============================================================================
; ENGINE MACHINERY — the anchor's registered-system set, and one rule not three
; ============================================================================
;
; `babylon-tick/src/lib.rs`'s `run_once_into` hardcodes the driver's
; registered-system set at `{economics, vitality, consciousness}` (Vitality
; landed the second of those). This port adds `lifecycle`, the same class
; of minimal, precedented change Vitality made to `tick.rs` for `:const`
; serving — driver scaffolding, not rule content, not BSL grammar.
;
; **One rule, not three — a slice-1 driver limit, not a modeling choice.**
; `run_once`/`run_once_into`'s `split_content` accepts exactly one `(rule …)`
; top-form per content set ("a content set needs exactly one (rule …)
; top-form", `rule_pipeline.rs`); Vitality never tested the other case
; because its own three phases already collapsed into one rule for an
; independent reason (§4.2's same-pre-state rule). This pack's three
; material processes ARE independent — none reads another's binding or
; effect — so nothing here is a re-derivation the way Vitality's phases
; were; they are grouped into one `(rule lifecycle/dpd-circuit …)` form
; purely because slice 1 has no multi-rule pack runner yet. Each of the
; three material processes below is commented as its own block and could
; split back into separate rules the moment the driver supports more than
; one per tick.
