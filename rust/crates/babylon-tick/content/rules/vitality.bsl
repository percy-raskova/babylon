; VitalitySystem (Material Base @1.0) — The Drain and The Reaper.
;
; Living costs wealth. A class burns subsistence every tick in proportion to
; its numbers and to the standard of living its position requires, and a
; block that can no longer cover its own reproduction stops existing.
;
; ONE rule, not three. §4.2: rules within one system position observe the
; same pre-state, so a three-rule decomposition would have to restate the
; drain algebra in each downstream rule. The `:expr` bindings of R9 chapter
; C7 name the intermediates once instead.
;
; GRINDING ATTRITION, LANDED — this header's old "WHAT THIS RULE
; DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO" block, rewritten as the record of what the
; engine now DOES (T6.5, #491 Phase 3b, 2026-08-21). The frozen system's
; Phase 2 lives in `vitality-attrition.bsl` as `vitality/subsistence-mortality`:
; `deaths = floor(population × failing-certain × κ)` — the mortality driver
; is the measured certainly-failing mass of the K=16 rung ladder (H2',
; DP-6 = B, D199), κ the derived-not-picked `1.0c` defconst (ADR210 R14;
; the derivation and divergence surface are D198, exhibited by
; `vitality_attrition_conformance.py`'s own sweep printer). The two
; blockers this block once recorded are both discharged: blocker 1 (the
; Real→Int demotion) by ADR188 Row 2's `floor` intrinsic, blocker 2 (the
; rate as stipulated form + tuned knob, `deficit × (attrition_base_factor +
; inequality)`) by the measure itself — `attrition_base_factor` is retired,
; NOT transcribed (ADR191 R3), and `social-class/inequality`'s dispersion-
; surrogate duty with it (§3.3b: entered the frozen form twice, threshold
; and slope; explained there, superseded by the ladder, retired at this
; port). What this file's rule still does not do: the drain and the reaper
; below remain this pack's whole behavior — mortality lives in the carrier
; pack, and the two packs are not co-loaded by any committed scenario
; today (D197's collision-surface note covers the one shared intrinsic
; declaration).
;
; HISTORY (immutable): the pre-T6 text of this block, and the two-blocker
; analysis it stood on, are in git at the `p27-python-freeze` pin and in
; the sweep's integration history (#678); docs/superpowers/plans/
; 2026-08-10-vitality-bsl-rule-pack.md §6 remains the blockers' design
; record.
