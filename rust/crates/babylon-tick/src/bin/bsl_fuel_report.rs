//! `bsl-fuel-report` — Task W3 (BSL Hygiene Knock-out train): the fuel-bound
//! report mode. Prints, for every rule in every landed content set,
//! `rule-id declared=<n> computed=<m> headroom=<n-m>` — the same numbers
//! `bound_checker::check_rule` already computes on a successful load
//! (`bound_checker.rs:757-769`, `LoadedRule::{declared_fuel, static_bound}`),
//! surfaced without the "red-run ritual" (temporarily lowering a rule's
//! `:fuel` until `E-LOAD-040` fires, just to read its error message's
//! `computed_bound`/`declared_budget` fields).
//!
//! This is a REPORT, not a gate: it runs no tick, calls no second
//! reader/parser (`babylon_tick::fuel_bound_report` is a thin wrapper over
//! `prepare_rules`, the identical seam `run_once` uses), and changes no
//! load behavior. Exit is non-zero ONLY when a rule's declared budget is
//! under its computed bound — a condition `E-LOAD-040` already refuses at
//! load, so in practice this branch is unreachable for any content set
//! that made it into a printed row at all (a `check_rule` failure there
//! surfaces as this binary's `Err` branch instead, before any row for that
//! content set exists) — see [`babylon_tick::any_over_budget`]'s own doc
//! for the same documented redundancy on the library side.
//!
//! **Content-set enumeration.** No `content-sets.toml` exists on this
//! branch (it lands with the #652 train — the controller addenda for this
//! task names it explicitly) — this binary hardcodes the same 13-pack,
//! one-scenario-per-pack SOLO pairing every dedicated
//! `tests/*_conformance.rs` file (and `tick_goldens.rs`) already
//! establishes as each pack's own canonical load, matching
//! `w2-preaudit-table.md` §1's identical "13 packs, solo everywhere except
//! two co-loads" finding for the same-tick-ordering checker.
//!
//! **Fix round 1 correction (`task-w3-review.md`, Medium finding #1):** the
//! original text here claimed the two committed co-loads
//! (`vitality+lifecycle`, `decomposition+control-ratio`) could be skipped
//! because they "would only ever repeat the same rule ids… without adding
//! new information." That is FALSE in general and was demonstrated false
//! for `control-ratio/c02-publish-census`: its three `(fold sum (nodes
//! NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS) …)` bindings scale the computed bound 1:1 with
//! the declared `SOCIAL_CLASS` ceiling (`fold_cost`, `bound_checker.rs:
//! 361`), and the solo scenario (`control-ratio-conformance.bscn`, 6
//! `SOCIAL_CLASS` nodes) differs from the real committed co-load scenario
//! (`carceral-arc-conformance.bscn`, 5) — so the solo-only report printed
//! a bound that never actually ships. **Bounds are per-SCENARIO, not
//! per-rule**: `SOLO_PACKS` and `CO_LOADS` below are both included, and a
//! rule that loads in more than one committed content set (every rule in
//! `decomposition`/`control-ratio`; every rule in `vitality`/`lifecycle`)
//! prints ONCE PER SET it actually loads in, each with that set's own real
//! ceilings. Two rows sharing a rule-id with DIFFERING computed/headroom
//! is the correct, honest output, not a duplicate to collapse —
//! `vitality`+`lifecycle` happen to always agree between their solo and
//! co-load rows (vacuously: neither file's rules contain a
//! `nodes`/`neighbors`/`fold` form at all, confirmed by grep, so no
//! ceiling is ever consulted), but that agreement is a fact about those
//! two files specifically, not a property this report can assume holds
//! for any other pair. The GREEN commit's own message asserted the false
//! "no new information" claim as a blanket property; per the standing
//! no-amend convention that message is not rewritten — this doc comment
//! and the fix-round commit are the correction of record.
//!
//! **Enumeration sentinel (Medium finding #2):** `SOLO_PACKS` is still a
//! hand-maintained table with no runtime link to `content/rules/*.bsl` — a
//! 14th landed pack this table forgets to add would previously make
//! `bsl-fuel-report` silently under-report it (still exit 0, no warning).
//! `tests::solo_packs_names_match_the_content_rules_directory_exactly`
//! (bottom of this file) closes that gap: it reads the real directory
//! listing at test time and fails loudly, by name, the moment the two
//! diverge — `mise run bsl:fuel-check` staying green is no longer
//! sufficient evidence that coverage is complete; `cargo test -p
//! babylon-tick --locked --bin bsl-fuel-report` is.
