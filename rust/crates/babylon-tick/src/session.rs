//! `TickSession` — the persistent load-once, advance-many seam B2 needs,
//! now multi-rule (Phase A, Tasks 2-4). `run_once`/`run_once_into`
//! (`lib.rs`) model one tick end to end and hardcode `run_tick`'s tick
//! argument to `1` for every rule the content set holds; a player-driven
//! loop needs the split this type provides instead: parse and load cost
//! paid ONCE in `new`, the SAME `PreparedRules` and the SAME graph reused
//! by every `advance()` call, every rule in the content set run once per
//! call in the governed 34-slot causal order, with `tick` incremented by
//! this type. D16's ascending rule-ID byte order breaks ties at one resolved
//! position.
