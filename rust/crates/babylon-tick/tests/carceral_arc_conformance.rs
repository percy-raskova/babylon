//! The JOINT ARC — Task 8 of the Decomposition (@11.0) + ControlRatio
//! (@12.0) port train (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-decomposition-
//! controlratio-port.md`). This is the train's ACCEPTANCE TEST: the ported
//! analogue of `tests/scenarios/test_carceral_equilibrium.py`'s
//! phase-sequence assertion (`TestCarceralEquilibrium::
//! test_default_trajectory_phases`), and the proof the two packs COMPOSE —
//! `content/rules/decomposition.bsl` (Pack A, which declares the ONE
//! `floor` intrinsic this arc needs) and `content/rules/control-ratio.bsl`
//! (Pack B, which declares none) CONCATENATED and loaded together against
//! ONE scenario, over a multi-tick `TickSession`.
//!
//! # Derived tick schedule — verified against the frozen mirror, not
//! trusted from the plan's own illustrative numbers (this task's own
//! brief)
//!
//! `carceral-arc-conformance.bscn`'s `la-approaching` reproduces
//! `decomposition-delay-conformance.bscn`'s DELAY-PATH vector (wealth 515,
//! strictly between `subsistence + 1*consumption` (510) and `subsistence +
//! 2*consumption` (520) — "approaching, not dying"), on the SHIPPED
//! `carceral/*` delays (`src/babylon/data/defines.yaml:293-300`:
//! `decomposition_delay=52`, `control_ratio_delay=52`,
//! `terminal_decision_delay=1`). The arithmetic, by hand and cross-checked
//! against the frozen mirror below:
//!
//! ```text
//! SUPERWAGE_CRISIS      tick 1    (la-approaching clears the approaching gate)
//! CLASS_DECOMPOSITION   tick 53   (1 + decomposition_delay(52))
//! CONTROL_RATIO_CRISIS  tick 105  (53 + control_ratio_delay(52))
//! TERMINAL_DECISION     tick 106  (105 + terminal_decision_delay(1))
//! ```
//!
//! # Frozen-mirror provenance
//!
//! `carceral_arc_conformance.py` runs the frozen `DecompositionSystem`
//! (@11.0) then `ControlRatioSystem` (@12.0), in that call order, EVERY
//! tick from 1 to 112, sharing ONE `TickContext.persistent_data` (matching
//! the frozen engine's own single `context` threaded through every system
//! every tick — the composition this whole arc proves the ported estate
//! reproduces despite §5's byte-order inversion, below). Run from the

//! Both the hand-derived arithmetic and the frozen mirror agree exactly —

//! ORDERING oracle, never a byte oracle; every numeric assertion below is
//! measured from THIS engine's own run).
//!
//! # The cross-pack byte-order inversion (§5) — why the schedule still
//! holds
//!
//! `control-ratio/*` sorts BEFORE `decomposition/*` in ascending rule-id
//! byte order (`'c' < 'd'` at the NAMESPACE segment — `control-ratio/`
//! vs `decomposition/` — the comparison already resolves there and never
//! reaches the rule-local `c01` vs `p01` prefixes), inverting the frozen
//! @11.0-then-@12.0 system order: within EVERY tick, `c01`-`c04` run to
//! completion before
//! `p01`-`p06` start. The only cross-pack datum `control-ratio/*` reads is
//! the carrier's `institution/decomposition-fire-tick`/`-fired-known`
//! (written by `decomposition/p03-trigger`) — so on the tick decomposition
//! ACTUALLY fires (tick 53 here), `c03`'s readiness gate reads THOSE
//! fields' PRE-tick-53 values (still 0, since `p03` has not run yet this
//! tick), one rule-order "behind". This is invisible to this arc's own
//! schedule because `control_ratio_delay` is the SHIPPED 52, not 0 — the
//! earliest `c03` could possibly fire is `53 + 52 = 105` regardless of
//! whether it sees `fired-known` become 1 on tick 53 or tick 54 (one
//! rule-order later than the write, but 51 ticks before the delay clears
//! either way). `the_byte_order_inversion_delays_a_same_tick_race_by_
//! exactly_one_tick` below is this constraint's EXECUTABLE form (plan §5's
//! own instruction: "a test that fails if the constraint is violated") —
//! an isolated, minimal fixture with `control-ratio-delay 0` and an
//! UNSEEDED fire tick, where the one-rule-order lag is the ONLY thing
//! standing between "no crisis" and "a crisis" on the firing tick.

/// this same tick, byte order — must NOT see those writes yet: its
/// readiness gate reads the PRE-tick-1 seeded values (both 0), so `ready`
/// is false and NO `CONTROL_RATIO_CRISIS` fires, even though the census
/// (0 enforcers, 100 prisoners, the zero-enforcer branch's "any nonzero
/// prisoner population is over capacity" shape) would otherwise clear
/// every other gate. At tick 2, `fired-known`/`fire-tick` are readable (the
/// writes are visible from the NEXT tick onward), `control-ratio-delay 0`
/// clears the delay check immediately (`2 >= 1 + 0`), and the crisis DOES
/// fire — proving the hazard is a benign ONE-TICK LAG, not a permanent
/// block (§5's own claim, made executable rather than asserted in prose).
