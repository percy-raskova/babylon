//! The Community @6.0 port train's conformance suite (issue #667, plan
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-18-community-port.md`, Task 7) — world 1
//! (`content/scenarios/community-conformance.bscn`), the frozen mirror
//! (`content/scenarios/community_conformance.py`), THE SPIKE's seven-shape
//! verdicts, and §8c's four permanent anti-pattern guards (landed here,
//! never deleted).
//!
//! # Task 7 deviations from the plan's letter (both recorded, both forced)
//!
//! 1. **Step 1's "expected FAIL (unregistered system)" never red-fired**:
//!    the `community` namespace was registered in `lib.rs`'s systems
//!    `HashSet` at **Task 4** (#681), one task earlier than the plan's
//!    Step 2 — the ceiling supply chain's RED tests needed the two refusal
//!    codes specifically, and an unregistered namespace fails E-LOAD-004
//!    one stage earlier (the registration comment in `lib.rs` says all of
//!    this). So this suite's load-smoke was green from birth; Step 2's
//!    "confirming the entry is genuinely new" discharges by READING that
//!    comment, not by re-adding the entry.
//! 2. **The "empty rule source" deviation, inherited**: `run_once_into`'s
//!    `split_content` refuses a content set with zero `(rule …)` top-forms
//!    outright (`decomposition_conformance.rs`'s Step-1 note and
//!    `production_conformance.rs:75-94` record the same), so the smoke
//!    test drives ONE minimal, never-firing probe rule.
//!
//! # The mirror's verbatim stdout (2026-08-22, python3 3.13)
//!
//! `community_conformance.py` is THE ORACLE (§9: standalone, no `babylon`
//! import, transcribing the planned rules c00→c11 over the literal WORLD).
//! Tasks 8-11 pin bit-exact against these values via the `.to_bits()`
//! idiom — **exact equality, no tolerance**, because every value here is
//! the same IEEE-754 operation chain the rules transcribe (the mirror's
//! header states the operation order per accumulator; shortest-repr
//! decimals round-trip through Rust's correctly-rounded parser to the same
//! binary64):

//! # THE SPIKE (Task 7 Step 5) — the seven-shape verdicts
//!
//! Each shape below was proven by a THROWAWAY rule against the real
//! `run_once_into` driver and THIS scenario, then deleted (the
//! solidarity-conformance.bscn:9-20 precedent — the scenario header
//! carries the same record). Verdicts:
//!
//! - **(a)** `for-each` over `(hyperedges HyperedgeType/COMMUNITY)` from a
//!   carrier-subject rule — **FIRES** (3 communities × 1 carrier = 3
//!   body-evaluations, verified by a write landing on all three).
//! - **(b)** `(update-hyperedge it community/heat (set …))` inside that
//!   body — **WRITES** (Task 6's own surface; read back bit-exact).
//! - **(c)** `(for-each (hyperedges-of self HyperedgeType/COMMUNITY) …)`
//!   from a SOCIAL_CLASS-subject rule + `(field-of it …)` read inside —
//!   **FIRES and READS** (na-worker sees exactly its two memberships, h0
//!   then h2, and the reads returned the seeded values).
//! - **(d)** repeated `(scale …)` accumulates multiplicatively across a
//!   `for-each` — **PROVEN**: two scales of 0.5c over na-worker's two
//!   memberships landed 1 → 0.25 on the probe field (the operand is
//!   pre-computed per collected write; the COMBINE reads the current value
//!   at APPLY, so the two scales compose as a product — §9 item 2's
//!   pre-state law governs operand evaluation, never the combine).
//! - **(e)** a 14-arm `if`-chain over the enum-field equality (`community/
//!   kind` against each CommunityType member) — **LOADS and EVALUATES**:
//!   each hyperedge's dispatch returned its own floor constant
//!   (0.136/0.0/0.04), the shape §6.2's c06 dispatch needs. The only
//!   landed precedent was 3-arm (`territory.bsl:130-137`); the 14-arm is
//!   now demonstrated, not merely plausible.
//! - **(f)** a same-tick cross-rule read of a hyperedge field written by
//!   an earlier rule — **SEES the new value** (§8b's fatal rows rely on
//!   exactly this; rule-id byte order `community/spike-a` <
//!   `community/spike-b` carried the write → read).
//! - **(g)** the world LOADS with a measured `E-LOAD-040`-bounded
//!   hyperedge-querying rule — Task 4's ceiling supply chain reaches this
//!   scenario: the probe's static bound passed with the census-fed
//!   `HyperedgeType/COMMUNITY` ceiling 3 and max-members 3.
//!
//! No shape refused; §8's rule split stands as planned.
//!
//! # The mirror pin (Task 8+)
