//! Pack B (`control-ratio/*`, Material Base @12.0) conformance — Task 5 of
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-decomposition-controlratio-port.md`
//! (frozen source: `src/babylon/engine/systems/control_ratio.py`, 248
//! lines). Branched off MERGED `dev` (never stacked on PR A, #193) — NO
//! Rust source edits; Task 1 already registered `"control-ratio"` in
//! `lib.rs`'s system `HashSet`.
//!
//! # Task 5 scope
//!
//! This task ships ONLY `c01-prisoner-census` + `c02-publish-census` — the
//! per-node census (the frozen `_count_enforcer_population`/`_count_
//! prisoner_population_and_org`, `control_ratio.py:53-85`, reformulated as
//! a per-node gated write plus a carrier-side fold, D138's precedent) and
//! its UNCONDITIONAL publication onto the carrier. `c03-crisis`/
//! `c04-terminal` (Tasks 6-7) are NOT this task's scope; the four
//! `.bscn` siblings this task creates (previous commit) are nonetheless
//! already shaped for ALL FOUR rules (their own headers state which single
//! constant each makes mutation-provable, mostly for Tasks 6-7), since
//! Task 6/7's own plan rows list no scenario-file edits — these four
//! worlds are this whole Pack B's ONLY scenario ceremony.
//!
//! # Step 1 red-phase note
//!
//! `c01_publishes_the_two_prisoner_roles_and_the_enforcer_count`,
//! `c01_premultiplies_population_by_organization`, and
//! `c02_publishes_the_three_aggregates_unconditionally` were written and
//! run against a `control-ratio.bsl` containing ONLY a placeholder
//! comment (zero `(rule …)` top-forms) BEFORE this commit. All failed
//! identically:
//!
//! ```text
//! the Pack B rules must run: "a content set needs at least one (rule …)
//! top-form, found 0 (§2.2 — intrinsic declarations do not count; deffield/
//! manifest/metric-decl top-forms are not yet split out by this function
//! and would also land here)"
//! ```
//!
//! — the same `run_once_into`'s own `split_content` refusal
//! `decomposition_conformance.rs`'s Task 1 red phase note already
//! recorded, confirming these tests reach the real loader rather than
//! failing for an unrelated reason (all four `.bscn` scenarios' own
//! declarations loaded clean on their own, proven independently by the
//! previous commit's `all_four_scenarios_load_clean_independent_of_any_
//! rule_pack`). Writing `c01`/`c02` into `control-ratio.bsl` turned every
//! test green.
//!
//! # Frozen-mirror provenance

//! overridden to 0 (`CarceralDefines(control_ratio_delay=0,

//!
//! **Task 5's own scope is the `census:` line of each world only** — the
//! `_count_enforcer_population`/`_count_prisoner_population_and_org`
//! outputs, which is exactly what `c01`/`c02` compute and publish. The
//! `post-tick persistent_data`/`events` sections are the frozen engine's
//! FULL `step()` (crisis + terminal decision both included, since the
//! frozen function has no Task boundary) — printed here for Tasks 6-7's
//! own future provenance; this task's Rust tests never assert against
//! them.
//!
//! # Why exact equality and no tolerance
//!
//! `Int * Real` is the only operation either engine performs to reach the
//! census numbers above — correctly-rounded binary64 both sides
//! (`bsl-language.rst` §4.3) — so this task's Rust-side pins assert exact
//! equality against BSL-measured values (ADR183: this mirror is a
//! structure/ordering oracle, not a byte oracle).
//!
//! # Fuel — measured, not guessed
//!
//! Per the E-LOAD-040 readback, then the documented `bound ≥ :fuel` /
//! runtime `bound + 1` off-by-one (`bsl-language.rst` §4.5,
//! `decomposition_conformance.rs`'s own retraction/correction paragraph):
//! `c01` declared with `:fuel 1` refused at load with `E-LOAD-040: rule
//! control-ratio/c01-prisoner-census static bound 42 exceeds its declared
//! :fuel 1`; `:fuel 43` (bound + 1) cleared both load and runtime. `c02`
//! (once `c01`'s fuel was raised) refused at `static bound 63` against the
//! PRIMARY/REVOLUTION worlds' own SOCIAL_CLASS ceiling (6 nodes — the
//! LARGEST of this pack's four scenarios); `:fuel 64` (bound + 1) cleared
//! load and runtime against ALL FOUR scenarios, since a fold's static
//! bound scales with the LOADING scenario's own SOCIAL_CLASS
//! `CardinalityCeiling` (`decomposition_conformance.rs`'s own Task 4
//! addendum: "one rule's fuel must cover the WORST-CASE ceiling across
//! every scenario that loads it") — the smaller worlds (3 SOCIAL_CLASS
//! nodes) and the inline NOT-READY fixture (2 SOCIAL_CLASS nodes) both
//! have smaller true bounds, comfortably inside `:fuel 64`.

//! # Task 6 — `c03-crisis` (the crisis gate, the `<=` boundary, BLOCKER-4)
//!
//! Ships `control-ratio/c03-crisis` — the readiness gate, the `<=` capacity
//! boundary, and BLOCKER-4's guard-split emit — into `control-ratio.bsl`
//! (already-complete file, this task's only edit). No new `.bscn` files:
//! Task 5's own four worlds were already shaped for this rule (their own
//! headers state which single constant each makes mutation-provable, mostly
//! for this task).
//!
//! ## Frozen-mirror provenance (already printed by Task 5's own mirror run)
//!
//! Task 5's `control_ratio_conformance.py` docstring already prints the
//! FULL event history for all four worlds against the frozen engine's
//! `_emit_crisis` (`control_ratio.py:175-208`), dated 2026-08-17 — the same
//! day as this task, against the same unmodified frozen source, so no
//! re-run was needed. Restated here as this task's own payload-key
//! provenance (see that comment block above for the full verbatim stdout):
//!
//! - PRIMARY/REVOLUTION (identical census): `control_ratio_crisis
//!   {'enforcer_population': 10, 'prisoner_population': 50,
//!   'control_capacity': 4, 'max_controllable': 40, 'actual_ratio': 5.0,
//!   'over_capacity_by': 10, 'control_ratio': 5.0, 'capacity_threshold':
//!   4.0, 'narrative_hint': …}` — `narrative_hint` dropped (D-record 5's
//!   class of omission), the other eight keys transcribed key-by-key,
//!   `control_ratio` duplicating `actual_ratio` verbatim (the frozen
//!   `:198-199` defect, port-as-is per ADR183).
//! - WITHIN-CAPACITY: `events: (none)` — the `<=` boundary (40 == 40), no
//!   crisis.
//! - ZERO-ENFORCER: `control_ratio_crisis {'enforcer_population': 0,
//!   'prisoner_population': 25, 'control_capacity': 4, 'max_controllable':
//!   0, 'actual_ratio': inf, 'over_capacity_by': 25, 'control_ratio': inf,
//!   'capacity_threshold': 4.0, …}` — `inf` is unrepresentable in BSL
//!   (BLOCKER-4); the ported payload OMITS `actual_ratio`/`control_ratio`
//!   entirely (six keys, not eight) rather than fabricating a number.
//!
//! ADR183 still governs: these are the STRUCTURE/ORDERING oracle (which
//! keys, in what order, present or loudly absent), never a byte oracle —
//! every numeric assertion below is measured from THIS engine's own run,
//! not copied from the floats quoted above.
//!
//! ## Fuel — measured, not guessed
//!
//! `c03` binds no `fold`/`nodes` query at all (every read is a fixed-cost
//! `:field`/`:const` on the ceiling-1 INSTITUTION singleton, p04-p06's own
//! "fuel is scenario-independent" precedent) — so, unlike `c02`, one
//! measurement covers every scenario that loads it. Per the E-LOAD-040
//! readback: `:fuel 1` refused at load with `E-LOAD-040: rule
//! control-ratio/c03-crisis static bound <N> exceeds its declared :fuel 1`;
//! `:fuel <N+1>` (measured bound + 1, §4.5) cleared load AND runtime
//! against all four `.bscn` scenarios plus the two inline ad-hoc worlds
//! (`c03_latches_once`'s two-tick session, `c03_stays_silent_before_the_
//! readiness_gate`'s not-ready fixture) — confirmed scenario-independent as
//! predicted, since every measurement below produced the identical static
//! bound.
//!
//! ## Mutation evidence
//!
//! `<=` -> `<` (i.e. `when`'s `(> prisoner-population max-controllable)`
//! weakened to `(>= prisoner-population max-controllable)`):
//! `c03_does_not_emit_at_or_below_capacity` flips red — the within-capacity
//! world (40 == 40) now clears the boundary and emits a spurious crisis.
//! Dropping the `actual-ratio` binding's internal `(if (= enforcer-
//! population 0) …)` protector (BLOCKER-4's mechanism (a), NOT the
//! effects-level guard-split (b), which alone would only silently skip the
//! emit) — replacing the whole binding with the bare `(/ prisoner-
//! population enforcer-population)` — makes EVERY assertion against the
//! zero-enforcer world abort with a NAMED `E-EVAL-012` division-by-zero
//! panic (`run_once_into` returns `Err`, and every test in this file calls
//! `.expect(...)` on it), not a silent pass: exercised directly against
//! this file's own `run()` helper, restored byte-identical afterward (`git
//! diff` clean before commit).
//!
//! ## Mirror reconciliation
//!
//! None needed — Task 5's mirror run already covers every world's full
//! event history (crisis AND terminal decision both, since the frozen
//! `step()` has no Task boundary); this task's tests assert only the
//! `control_ratio_crisis` line of each already-printed block.

//! # Task 7 — `c04-terminal` (the terminal decision, ADR070-RESERVED)
//!
//! **This task touches the Director-reserved line** (Constitution IX.5 /
//! ADR070 / Program 19). Discipline: TRANSCRIBE, do not redesign — same
//! threshold source (`carceral.revolution_threshold`), same `>=`
//! comparison, same two outcomes, verbatim under a P19-cutover-pending
//! D-record. Ships `control-ratio/c04-terminal` into `control-ratio.bsl`
//! (already-complete file, this task's only rule-content edit). No new
//! `.bscn` files: the primary/revolution worlds cover two of this task's
//! six fixtures; the other four are inline ad-hoc worlds, imitating Task
//! 6's own `NOT_READY_SCENARIO` shape (a lean enforcer + prisoner(s) +
//! carrier cast, no bourgeois/inactive witnesses — those gates are already
//! proven by `c01`'s own tests).
//!
//! ## Frozen-mirror provenance
//!
//! Two of six fixtures reuse worlds already fully mirrored by Task 5's own
//! run (see that comment block above): PRIMARY (genocide, `avg_organization
//! = 0.2`) and REVOLUTION (`avg_organization = 0.6`) — their
//! `terminal_decision` lines are this task's own payload-key provenance,
//! restated here (Task 6's own convention):
//!
//! - PRIMARY: `terminal_decision {'outcome': 'genocide', 'avg_organization':
//!   0.2, 'revolution_threshold': 0.5, 'prisoner_population': 50,
//!   'enforcer_population': 10, 'narrative_hint': …}` — `narrative_hint`
//!   dropped (D-record 5), `outcome` becomes numeric `(outcome 0)`.
//! - REVOLUTION: `terminal_decision {'outcome': 'revolution',
//!   'avg_organization': 0.6, 'revolution_threshold': 0.5,
//!   'prisoner_population': 50, 'enforcer_population': 10, …}` — `(outcome
//!   1)`.
//!
//! The other two NUMERIC fixtures (the exact-threshold boundary and the
//! population-weighted guard) are NEW — `control_ratio_conformance.py` was
//! extended with `EXACT_THRESHOLD_CLASSES` / `POPULATION_WEIGHTED_CLASSES`
//! and re-run (`PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" UV_FROZEN=1 uv run python
//! rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/scenarios/control_ratio_conformance.py`),
//! 2026-08-17, against the frozen engine, verbatim:
//!
//! ```text
//! === control-ratio-exact-threshold (Task 7 ad-hoc #1) ===
//!   census: enforcer_population=10 prisoner_population=50 prisoner_org_weighted_sum=25.0
//!   events:
//!     terminal_decision {'outcome': 'revolution', 'avg_organization': 0.5, 'revolution_threshold': 0.5, 'prisoner_population': 50, 'enforcer_population': 10, 'narrative_hint': 'REVOLUTION: …'}
//!
//! === control-ratio-population-weighted (Task 7 ad-hoc #2) ===
//!   census: enforcer_population=10 prisoner_population=100 prisoner_org_weighted_sum=42.5
//!   events:
//!     terminal_decision {'outcome': 'genocide', 'avg_organization': 0.425, 'revolution_threshold': 0.5, 'prisoner_population': 100, 'enforcer_population': 10, 'narrative_hint': 'GENOCIDE: …'}
//! ```
//!
//! The exact-threshold world (organization exactly 0.5 on both active
//! prisoner nodes, same 30+20 population split as PRIMARY/REVOLUTION) is
//! the frozen suite's own `TestControlRatioMutationKillers` target: AT the
//! threshold routes REVOLUTION (`>=`, not `>`). The population-weighted
//! world (5 prisoners @ organization 0.9, 95 @ 0.4) is the intensive-
//! aggregation guard: the population-weighted average (0.425) routes
//! GENOCIDE while the UNWEIGHTED bare mean of the two organization values
//! ((0.9 + 0.4) / 2 = 0.65) would route REVOLUTION instead — proving the
//! routing decision is load-bearing on the population-weighted
//! computation, not a bare per-class mean.
//!
//! The terminal-delay fixture (`c04_respects_the_terminal_delay`) has no
//! frozen single-`step()` analogue at all — it exercises BSL's own
//! multi-tick rule-latch timing (crisis latches at tick 1, the terminal
//! decision's own delay-elapsed gate clears one tick later), the same class
//! of BSL-mechanism-only test as `c03_stays_silent_before_the_readiness_
//! gate`'s own "Mirror reconciliation: none needed" (Task 6).
//!
//! ADR183 still governs: the mirror is the STRUCTURE/ORDERING oracle
//! (which keys, in what order, which outcome), never a byte oracle — every
//! numeric assertion below is measured from THIS engine's own run.
//!
//! ## Fuel — measured, not guessed
//!
//! `c04` binds no `fold`/`nodes` query (every read is a fixed-cost
//! `:field`/`:const`/`:tick` on the ceiling-1 INSTITUTION singleton, `c03`'s
//! own "fuel is scenario-independent" precedent) — one measurement covers
//! every scenario/fixture that loads it. Per the E-LOAD-040 readback:
//! `:fuel 27` (a guess) refused at load with `E-LOAD-040: rule
//! control-ratio/c04-terminal static bound 45 exceeds its declared :fuel
//! 27`; `:fuel 46` (measured bound 45 + 1, §4.5) cleared load AND runtime
//! against all six fixtures (the four `.bscn` siblings plus the two inline
//! ad-hoc worlds this task adds — `c04_at_exactly_the_threshold_routes_to_
//! revolution`'s and `the_avg_organization_is_population_weighted_not_a_
//! bare_mean`'s own scenarios — plus the terminal-delay `TickSession`
//! fixture).
//!
//! ## Mutation evidence
//!
//! `>=` -> `>` (the FIRST guard's `(>= avg-organization revolution-
//! threshold)` alone, the SECOND guard's `(< …)` left untouched):
//! `c04_at_exactly_the_threshold_routes_to_revolution` flips red — AT the
//! threshold (0.5 == 0.5) now matches NEITHER guard (`0.5 > 0.5` is false,
//! `0.5 < 0.5` is false), so `outcome` reads back as the ZERO default
//! (`left: 0, right: 1`) rather than the frozen `>=`'s REVOLUTION — every
//! other test stays green (exercised directly against this file's own
//! `run()`/`TickSession` harness, restored byte-identical afterward, `git
//! diff` clean before commit). Swapping the two outcome codes (`(outcome
//! 1)` <-> `(outcome 0)` across the two guard bodies) flips FOUR tests red
//! simultaneously, not merely the two routing tests: `c04_routes_to_
//! genocide_below_the_threshold`, `c04_routes_to_revolution_at_or_above_
//! the_threshold`, `c04_at_exactly_the_threshold_routes_to_revolution`, and
//! `the_avg_organization_is_population_weighted_not_a_bare_mean` — every
//! test asserting `outcome` at all. Restored byte-identical afterward.
//!
//! **The division-by-zero protector's own caveat is DISCHARGED** (final
//! review I2's round-2 gate restoration; the rule file's own D-record 5/5b
//! addenda): the ORIGINAL claim here — that no fixture in this pack ever
//! reaches `prisoner-population == 0` at a tick `c04` evaluates, so
//! replacing `avg-organization`'s protected `:expr` with a bare `(/
//! prisoner-org-weighted prisoner-population)` flips nothing red — no
//! longer holds. `c04_does_not_emit_when_the_terminal_tick_census_has_
//! zero_prisoners` (below) seeds exactly that world; `:expr` bindings
//! evaluate eagerly regardless of `when` (BLOCKER-4's own mechanism), so
//! the protector IS evaluated there even though the (round-2-restored)
//! `when` refuses the emit. Re-exercised directly: dropping the protector
//! now aborts THAT ONE test with a NAMED `E-EVAL-012`, the other 23 tests
//! in this file staying green — mutation-provable now, like `c03`'s own
//! BLOCKER-4 protector, restored byte-identical afterward.
//!
//! ## Final review fix-forward — I2 (round-2 gate restoration)
//!
//! `c04`'s original `when` (`ready ∧ terminal-decision-emitted == 0`)
//! dropped two of the frozen `step()`'s five early returns:
//! `if prisoner_pop == 0: return` (`:141-142`) and `if prisoner_pop <=
//! max_controllable: return` (`:150-151`, D-record 3's SAME `<=`
//! boundary) — both re-evaluated on the terminal tick against the FRESH
//! same-tick census, since `step()` is one function re-executed from the
//! top on every call. Restored as two added `when` conjuncts (a new
//! `control-capacity` `:const` and `max-controllable` `:expr` binding
//! pair) — proven by `c04_does_not_emit_when_the_terminal_tick_census_
//! has_zero_prisoners` and `c04_does_not_emit_when_the_terminal_tick_
//! census_falls_back_within_capacity` below, both of which flip red under
//! `when`'s pre-round-2 shape (exercised directly, restored byte-identical
//! afterward). c04's own `:fuel` moved 46 -> 54 (measured bound 53 + 1,
//! §4.5) for the two new bindings.
//!
//! ### Frozen-mirror provenance (both new fixtures)
//!
//! `control_ratio_conformance.py`'s own `WORLDS_WITH_PRIOR_CRISIS` loop —
//! `persistent_data` PRE-SEEDED as though the crisis already fired and
//! latched at tick 0 (`_control_crisis_emitted=True`,
//! `_control_ratio_crisis_tick=0`, matching each BSL fixture's own carrier
//! seed) — re-run against the frozen engine, 2026-08-17, verbatim:
//!
//! ```text
//! === control-ratio-terminal-gate-zero-prisoners (I2 fix-forward #1) ===
//!   census: enforcer_population=10 prisoner_population=0 prisoner_org_weighted_sum=0.0
//!   post-tick persistent_data:
//!     _class_decomposition_tick = 0
//!     _control_crisis_emitted = True
//!     _control_ratio_crisis_tick = 0
//!   events:
//!     (none)
//!
//! === control-ratio-terminal-gate-within-capacity (I2 fix-forward #2) ===

//! ```
//!
//! `_terminal_decision_emitted` is ABSENT from both post-tick dumps, not
//! merely `False` — the early return fires before `step()` ever reaches
//! the line that would set it, confirming the gate fires exactly where
//! `control_ratio.py:141-142`/`:150-151` place it. Both BSL fixtures below
//! assert the SAME shape: zero `TERMINAL_DECISION` events and
//! `terminal-decision-emitted` staying at its seeded 0.

// only past FIVE early returns in total, not the three `c04`'s original
// `when` transcribed. Two more sit BEFORE the crisis-emit/terminal-delay
// logic and are re-evaluated on the terminal tick against a FRESHLY
// recomputed census, exactly like every other tick's call: `if
// prisoner_pop == 0: return` (`:141-142`) and `if prisoner_pop <=
// max_controllable: return` (`:150-151`, the SAME `<=` boundary D-record 3
// already transcribes into `c03`). A world where the crisis fired but the
// census falls back — prisoners to zero, or back within capacity — before
// the terminal tick must NOT emit `TERMINAL_DECISION`, even though the
// crisis was already latched and the delay has elapsed. Both fixtures
// below pre-seed the carrier as "crisis already fired at tick 0" (the same
// ad-hoc-fixture idiom `c03_stays_silent_before_the_readiness_gate` and
// Task 7's `EXACT_THRESHOLD_SCENARIO` already use) and vary ONLY the
// current-tick `SOCIAL_CLASS` census `c01`/`c02` publish this same tick,
// ahead of `c04` in byte order — proving the two round-2 conjuncts, not
// the delay/latch gates `c04_respects_the_terminal_delay`/`c04_emits_once`
// already cover.
//
// Mutation evidence: reverting `c04`'s `when` to `(and ready (=
// terminal-decision-emitted 0))` (dropping the two round-2 conjuncts)
// flips BOTH tests below red — `c04_does_not_emit_when_the_terminal_tick_
// census_has_zero_prisoners` emits a spurious GENOCIDE (`avg-organization`
// resolves to its own zero-population protector default, `0.0 < 0.5`),
// exactly the false-positive the final review's I2 finding names;
// `c04_does_not_emit_when_the_terminal_tick_census_falls_back_within_
// capacity` emits a spurious REVOLUTION (`avg-organization` 0.6 >= 0.5).
// Exercised directly against this file's own `run()` helper, restored
// byte-identical afterward (`git diff` clean before commit).
//
// D-record 5 update: the zero-prisoners fixture ALSO discharges this
// pack's own "honest caveat" above — `:expr` bindings evaluate eagerly
// regardless of `when` (BLOCKER-4's mechanism, this file's own Task 6/7
// precedent), so `avg-organization`'s protected ternary IS evaluated for
// THIS fixture even though the (now-restored) `when` refuses the emit;
// replacing the protector with a bare division aborts this world's own
// `run()` call with a NAMED `E-EVAL-012`, not a silent pass — no longer
// merely "kept for :171's own fidelity", now mutation-provable like
// `c03`'s own BLOCKER-4 protector.
