//! Registration + scenario-ceremony conformance for the joint Decomposition
//! (@11.0) + ControlRatio (@12.0) port train — Task 1 of
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-decomposition-controlratio-port.md`
//! (frozen source: `src/babylon/engine/systems/decomposition.py`, 370
//! lines, + `src/babylon/engine/systems/control_ratio.py`, 248 lines).
//!
//! # Task 1 scope
//!
//! This task ships NO `decomposition/*`/`control-ratio/*` rule pack content
//! (that is Task 2 onward) — it registers both systems in `lib.rs`, builds
//! the shared conformance world (`content/scenarios/
//! decomposition-conformance.bscn`), carries the frozen-mirror provenance
//! below, and records THE SPIKE verdict (plan §2's RISK box) that later
//! tasks depend on.
//!
//! # Step 1 red-phase note
//!
//! `scenario_and_empty_pack_load` (below) was written and run BEFORE
//! `"decomposition"`/`"control-ratio"` were added to `lib.rs`'s
//! registered-system `HashSet`; it failed with:
//!
//! ```text
//! rule decomposition/probe rejected: E-LOAD-002: rule decomposition/probe
//! carries no anchor and its first id segment names no registered system —
//! a rule cannot land nowhere (§2.3)
//! ```
//!
//! — confirming the probe reaches the real anchor check
//! (`mod_anchors::check_anchor` against `ctx.systems`, `rule_pipeline.rs:313`)
//! rather than failing for an unrelated reason (the scenario's own
//! declarations loaded clean). Registering both systems turned it green.
//! Same deviation from the plan's literal "empty rule source" text that
//! `production_conformance.rs:75-94` already recorded: `run_once_into`'s own
//! `split_content` refuses a content set with zero `(rule …)` top-forms
//! outright, so a truly empty source cannot reach the anchor check at all;
//! this test uses two minimal, never-firing probe rules instead, one per
//! newly-registered system.
//!
//! # THE SPIKE (Step 5) — verdict
//!
//! Two throwaway spike rules were run through the real `run_once_into`
//! driver against this exact scenario, then deleted (their bodies never
//! landed in this file):
//!
//! - **(a)** a carrier-anchored rule (`:field institution/…` binding) folding
//!   `(fold sum (nodes NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS) (field-of it
//!   social-class/population))` into `institution/la-population` — LOADED,
//!   EVALUATED, and produced the correct sum: `1000 + 20 + 77 + 200 + 10 =
//!   1307`, asserted directly against the post-tick graph before deletion.
//! - **(b)** a class-anchored rule reading `(field-of (select-max (nodes
//!   NodeType/INSTITUTION) 1) institution/decomposition-complete)` — LOADED
//!   AND EVALUATED CLEAN.
//!
//! **Neither shape refused.** The incidence-edge fallback design (seeding a
//! carrier→class edge and reading via `neighbors`) is NOT needed; Task 2
//! onward relies on both shapes directly, exactly as plan §2 specifies. This
//! is also the FIRST landed content to use `NodeType/INSTITUTION` as a
//! singleton carrier reached via `(select-max (nodes NodeType/INSTITUTION)
//! 1)`, and the FIRST to fold over `(nodes NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS)` rather
//! than a `neighbors` query — every prior `fold`/`select-max` in the landed
//! estate reads `neighbors` (`territory.bsl:157-160`, `production.bsl:172-
//! 175`), which is capability precedent, not content precedent; this
//! scenario is the content precedent.
//!
//! # Frozen-mirror provenance
//!
//! Every state value below was printed by the frozen `DecompositionSystem`
//! (@11.0) then `ControlRatioSystem` (@12.0), one `step()` each, sharing ONE
//! `TickContext.persistent_data` dict (matching the frozen engine's own
//! single `context` threaded through every system in a tick), over a
//! fixture that mirrors `decomposition-conformance.bscn` node for node. The
//! command, from the repository root:
//!
//! ```text
//! PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" UV_FROZEN=1 uv run python \
//!     rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/scenarios/decomposition_conformance.py
//! ```
//!
//! Its output on 2026-08-17, verbatim:
//!
//! ```text
//! defines (src/babylon/data/defines.yaml, carceral: section):
//!   carceral.control_capacity = 4

//! ```
//!
//! **Both the early-warning `SUPERWAGE_CRISIS` and the fallback-triggered
//! `CLASS_DECOMPOSITION` fire in the SAME tick** — a real, observed frozen
//! behavior, not a design assumption: `la-dying`'s wealth (400) is both
//! `< subsistence_threshold + 2*consumption` (500 + 2*10 = 520, the
//! "approaching" early-warning gate) AND `< subsistence_threshold` (500, the
//! `la_about_to_die` fallback gate), and `DecompositionSystem.step()`
//! evaluates both gates sequentially within one call
//! (`decomposition.py:179-223`) with no tick-order separation between them.
//! `ip-seed`'s OVERWRITE (`population: 77 -> 850`, NOT `77 + 850`) versus
//! `enforcer-seed`'s ADDITIVE gain (`population: 20 -> 170 = 20 + 150`) is
//! exactly the two mutation shapes the scenario's own header names as
//! provable by this fixture's non-zero pre-seeds.
//!
//! # Why exact equality and no tolerance
//!
//! `Int * Real` and `int()` truncation are the only operations either engine
//! performs to reach the numbers above — both correctly-rounded binary64
//! (`bsl-language.rst` §4.3) — so later tasks' Rust-side pins may assert
//! exact equality against BSL-measured values, not against these printed
//! floats (ADR183: this mirror is a structure/ordering oracle, not a byte
//! oracle; no `decomposition/*`/`control-ratio/*` rule exists yet in Task 1
//! to measure BSL-side numbers from).
//!
//! # Task 2 — Pack A's p01 (LA census) + p02 (early warning)
//!
//! The four tests below are the first `decomposition/*` rules to run
//! against this world; every asserted value is measured from the BSL engine
//! itself (`content/rules/decomposition.bsl`), cross-checked by hand against
//! the frozen mirror's dump above: `la-dying`'s census carries its own
//! population (1000) and wealth (400.0) exactly, both flags fire (wealth
//! 400 < subsistence 500 < subsistence + 2*consumption 520), and every
//! other class's four census fields stay at their seeded 0 (the D127
//! hash-neutral idiom — p01 has no `when` clause). `SUPERWAGE_CRISIS` fires
//! exactly once with the flattened 3-key payload (D-records 4/5 in
//! `decomposition.bsl`'s header: `payer_id`/`narrative_hint` dropped, no
//! string payloads on `emit`), and the carrier latches
//! `superwage-crisis-known`/`-tick` (1 / tick 1) the SAME tick — matching
//! the frozen mirror's `_superwage_crisis_tick = 1`.
//!
//! **Fuel — measured, not guessed, per the E-LOAD-040 refusal readback,
//! THEN the documented `bound ≥ :fuel` / runtime `bound + 1` off-by-one
//! (`bsl-language.rst` §4.5, "authors should budget `:fuel ≥ bound + 1`"):**
//! p01's rule declared with `:fuel 1` refused at load with `E-LOAD-040:
//! rule decomposition/p01-la-census static bound 72 exceeds its declared
//! :fuel 1`; p02 (once p01's fuel was raised) refused the same way at
//! `static bound 32`. Setting `:fuel` to those EXACT computed bounds (72,
//! 32) loads clean but then `E-EVAL-040`s at runtime ("fuel meter reached
//! zero") — the documented §3.7/§4.5 boundary: the load check accepts
//! `bound == :fuel`, but the runtime meter must stay strictly positive, so
//! the true minimum is `bound + 1`. `:fuel 73` / `:fuel 33` (measured
//! bound + 1, not a round margin) is what the rules below declare.
//!
//! # Task 3 — Pack A's p03 (the carrier trigger + the frozen split)
//!
//! `p03-trigger`'s fuel, measured the same way: `:fuel 1` refused at load
//! with `E-LOAD-040: rule decomposition/p03-trigger static bound 168
//! exceeds its declared :fuel 1`. Setting `:fuel 168` (the exact bound) —
//! UNLIKE p01/p02 — loaded AND ran clean, with no `E-EVAL-040` at runtime.
//!
//! **Retraction (fix round 1, PR review): the headroom is NOT a `guard`
//! effect.** A `guard` charges its body exactly once regardless of whether
//! its condition passes — `cost(guard) = 1 + cost(cond) + Σ cost(effects)`
//! (`bound_checker.rs:259-263`) — so a `guard` creates no static/dynamic
//! gap by itself, and every `:expr` binding (including `fallback-fire` and
//! `delay-elapsed-fire`, both bound BEFORE `should-fire`) evaluates
//! eagerly and unconditionally, once per subject per tick, regardless of
//! what any later binding or guard does (`rule_pipeline.rs::
//! resolve_expr_bindings`). The ORIGINAL claim in this paragraph — that
//! the guard's tick-1-fires/tick-2-skips shape explains the headroom — is
//! WRONG and is retracted; it must not become precedent for Task 4/5 fuel
//! budgeting.
//!
//! **The real mechanism: `or` short-circuits (§4.1, `evaluator.rs:636-
//! 658`).** `should-fire`'s own body is `(and (or fallback-fire delay-
//! elapsed-fire) …)` — and because `fallback-fire`/`delay-elapsed-fire`
//! are themselves PRE-BOUND named bindings by the time `should-fire`
//! evaluates, referencing either inside this `or` is a single `Symbol`
//! variable lookup costing exactly `cost::VARIABLE_REF = 1`
//! (`fuel.rs:23`), not a re-evaluation of the whole named expression. The
//! static bound counts BOTH operands of every `or`/`and` unconditionally
//! (`bound_checker.rs`'s `sum_costs` has no short-circuit-aware branch);
//! at runtime, `fallback-fire` evaluates `#t` first and `or` returns
//! immediately (`stop_on = true` for `or`, `evaluator.rs:645-658`),
//! skipping the `delay-elapsed-fire` variable-ref read entirely. That
//! skipped read is the ENTIRE headroom: exactly 1 fuel unit. `charge`'s
//! exhaustion check is strict `amount >= *fuel` (`evaluator.rs:330-337`,
//! the meter must stay strictly positive) — consuming `bound - 1 = 167`
//! against a `168`-unit budget leaves exactly 1 unit of slack at every
//! charge point along the way, which is exactly why `:fuel 168` cleared
//! runtime here and nowhere else in this pack. This is a FRAGILE,
//! fixture-specific 1-unit margin (it depends on `fallback-fire`
//! evaluating true before `delay-elapsed-fire` is read, which depends on
//! THIS fixture's fallback-trigger vector), not a structural property of
//! `guard` or of this rule shape in general — it must not be relied on for
//! any other rule's fuel budgeting. `:fuel 169` (measured bound + 1) is
//! declared below anyway, matching the §4.5 authors-should-budget
//! convention p01/p02 already follow, rather than relying on this
//! particular fixture's short-circuit margin.
//!
//! # Task 4 addendum — p03's static bound is SCENARIO-DEPENDENT
//!
//! `:fuel 169` (measured against the 5-`SOCIAL_CLASS` primary world) was
//! insufficient once Task 4's `decomposition-delay-conformance.bscn`
//! (Task 4 carried mutation obligation 11's `la-inactive`, a SIXTH
//! `SOCIAL_CLASS` node) tried to load the same rule set: `E-LOAD-040: rule
//! decomposition/p03-trigger static bound 176 exceeds its declared :fuel
//! 169`. This is the direct, mechanical consequence of `p03`'s four
//! `(fold sum (nodes NodeType/SOCIAL_CLASS) …)` bindings — each fold's
//! static bound scales with the SOCIAL_CLASS `CardinalityCeiling` the
//! LOADING scenario itself mints (plan §2's own "which also statically
//! bounds every fold over it", Power-of-10 rule 2), so one rule's fuel
//! must cover the WORST-CASE ceiling across every scenario that loads it,
//! not just the one it was first measured against. Re-measured via the
//! same E-LOAD-040 readback against the LARGER world: bound 176, declared
//! `:fuel 177` (measured bound + 1) below — comfortably covers the
//! 5-class primary world's bound (168) and the Task 4 zero-population
//! inline world's (1 SOCIAL_CLASS node, smaller still) too.
//! `p04-enforcer-intake`/`p05-ip-intake`/`p06-la-deactivate` bind no
//! `nodes`/`fold` query at all (every carrier read is a fixed-cost
//! `select-max` over the ceiling-1 INSTITUTION singleton), so their own
//! fuel is scenario-independent — declared once, measured once, below.
