//! The NEGATIVE-INPUT (per-term floor, plus `foreclosure-rate`'s ceiling)
//! conformance suite for `dispossession/territory-transfer` — the
//! adversarial-review follow-up (F2, PR #498) that proves the per-term
//! clamps D-4 restores are structurally different from clamping only the
//! total. This scenario covers `foreclosure-rate`'s CEILING plus every
//! OTHER input's FLOOR (`eviction-rate`/`displacement-rate`/
//! `concentrated-ownership`/`absentee-landlord-share`, all pushed negative
//! at once — one primary rate has to stay positive to keep the `(when …)`
//! gate open, so `foreclosure-rate` draws double duty as ceiling probe and
//! anchor). `dispossession-ceiling-matrix-conformance.rs` completes the
//! remaining four ceilings.

//! PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" uv run python \

//! ```
//!
//! Its output, verbatim:
//!
//! ```text
//! post-tick state:
//!   negative-input-county  wealth=996000.0 dispossession_intensity=0.4
//!
//! events:
//!   value_transfer {'territory': 'negative-input-county', 'total_transferred': 4000.0,
//!                    'net_received': 4000.0, 'deadweight_loss': 0.0}
//!   dispossession_event {'territory': 'negative-input-county', 'intensity': 0.4,
//!                         'foreclosure_rate': 5.0, 'eviction_rate': 0.0,
//!                         'displacement_rate': 0.0}
//! ```
//!
//! Three things worth flagging explicitly:
//!
//! - `intensity` is exactly `0.4` (`weight_foreclosure * 1.0`, the CEILING-
//!   clamped value of `foreclosure-rate=5`) — the negative `eviction-rate`
//!   (`-3`) contributes NOTHING, floored to `0.0` before it is ever
//!   weighted. A total-only floor (this pack's pre-fix shape) would instead
//!   have summed `0.4*5 + 0.3*(-3) = 1.1` and THEN floored/ceiled the
//!   total — landing on `1.0`, not `0.4`: a materially different number
//!   reached by a materially different (and wrong) route.
//! - `foreclosure-rate=5` proves the per-input CEILING clamp does real
//!   work: ceiling-clamped to `1.0` it lands on the SAME intensity a seed
//!   of `1.0` already at the boundary would — which a fixture that never
//!   exceeds `1.0` (`dispossession-saturation-conformance.bscn`'s own rates
//!   included) cannot prove, since `min(1.0, 1.0)` is a no-op whether or
//!   not the clamp exists.
//! - The `DISPOSSESSION_EVENT` payload's `foreclosure_rate` is `5.0` (the
//!   FLOOR-ONLY, NOT ceiling-clamped, raw seed) and `eviction_rate` is
//!   `0.0` (floored from `-3.0`) — the frozen engine's payload reads the
//!   FLOOR-ONLY outer variables (`dispossession_events.py`'s own
//!   `foreclosure_rate`/`eviction_rate`, never `state.*`), confirming D-4's
//!   floor/ceiling split is the payload's actual behavior, not merely this
//!   pack's convenience.
