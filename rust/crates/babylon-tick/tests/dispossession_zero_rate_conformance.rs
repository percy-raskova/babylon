//! The DISCRIMINATING conformance suite for `dispossession/territory-transfer`
//! — proves the frozen `when`-equivalent gate is inert on the shipped
//! canonical world, exactly the way `dispossession_events.py` is today.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! ```text
//! PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" uv run python \
//!     rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/scenarios/dispossession_zero_rate_conformance.py
//! ```
//!
//! Its output on 2026-08-11, verbatim:
//!
//! ```text
//! post-tick state (must equal the pre-tick seed exactly — no writes):
//!   dormant-county-1   wealth=1000000.0 dispossession_intensity=None (seed wealth was 1000000.0)
//!   dormant-county-2   wealth=500000.0 dispossession_intensity=None (seed wealth was 500000.0)
//!
//! events:
//!   (none)
//! ```
//!
//! `dispossession_intensity=None` means the frozen engine's graph dict never
//! gained the key at all — the Rust seed uses `0` as a placeholder (BSL
//! requires every declared field to carry SOME seed value; Python's dict can
//! simply lack the key), so the assertion below checks the seed value is
//! UNCHANGED, not that it equals Python's `None`.
//!
//! `dispossession_events.py:75-76`'s `continue` reads only the three PRIMARY
//! rates (foreclosure/eviction/displacement) — `concentrated_ownership`/
//! `absentee_landlord_share` are deliberately nonzero in this scenario, and
//! the frozen engine still skips both subjects whole. That is the exact
//! fidelity claim this suite exists to prove, not an incidental detail.
