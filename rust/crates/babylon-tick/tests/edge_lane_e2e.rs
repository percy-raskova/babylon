//! The three T2 slice-2 edge-lane end-to-end vectors (Program 29 train T2,
//! issue #559; plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-12-t2-slice2-edge-reads-
//! plan.md`, Task 6).
//!
//! **This ships no Solidarity content.** It proves the three slice-2 heads —
//! `edges`, `edge-between`, `field-of` over an `EdgeRef` — evaluate
//! correctly through the real production entry point
//! (`babylon_tick::run_once_into`, the same seam the CLI driver and
//! `babylon-client`'s engine link both call), over a hand-built fixture
//! (`content/scenarios/edge-lane-e2e.bscn`) anticipatory of Solidarity's own
//! read shape (`bsl-language.rst` §3.8 item 8's worked example) — the same
//! posture `query_lane_e2e.rs` took for Territory's shapes.
//!
//! Each shape below runs as its OWN single-rule content set, loaded fresh
//! from the ONE shared scenario file each time — no shape's tick can observe
//! another shape's writes, and the cross-RULE pre-state gap (D-row Q14)
//! never applies: nothing in this file ever loads more than one `(rule …)`
//! form in the same `rule_src`.
//!
//! **Why every rule declares `social-class/shape`.** `run_tick`'s subject
//! loop walks EVERY node of a rule's derived subject type; `social-class/
//! shape` is the discriminator that keeps each shape's rule from firing on
//! the eleven nodes it does not own (the `territory/shape` convention,
//! `query_lane_e2e.rs`).
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Every expected value below is DERIVED in its test's own comment from the
//! scenario's seeded strengths. Every seeded strength is an exact dyadic
//! rational (a fraction whose denominator is a power of two — `0.1875 =
//! 3/16`, `0.375 = 3/8` are not powers of two themselves, but terminate
//! exactly in binary64, which is the property that matters), and every fold
//! sum below is a sum of exact dyadic rationals whose intermediate and final
//! values are all exactly representable — so IEEE-754 addition is EXACT at
//! every step, plain `f64` equality is the right assertion, and no
//! `to_bits()` pin is needed (`query_lane_e2e.rs` pins bits only where a
//! multiply introduces real rounding; nothing here multiplies).
