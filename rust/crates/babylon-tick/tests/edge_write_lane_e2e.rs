//! The T3 edge-WRITE-lane end-to-end vectors (Program 29 train T3 PR B,
//! issue #560; ADR198 R1-R3) — `update-edge` executed through the real
//! production entry point (`babylon_tick::run_once_into` → `run_tick`'s
//! collect-then-apply, the same seam the CLI driver and `babylon-client`'s
//! engine link both call), against T3 PR A's storage.
//!
//! **This ships no Solidarity content** — the same posture `edge_lane_e2e.rs`
//! took for the read half: the fixture (`content/scenarios/edge-write-lane-
//! e2e.bscn`) is a hand-built minimal world and the rules are the §2.10/§6.2
//! worked shapes, not a port. Each shape runs as its OWN single-rule content
//! set, loaded fresh from the one shared scenario file each time
//! (`edge_lane_e2e.rs`'s discipline — no shape's tick can observe another
//! shape's writes).
//!
//! What these two vectors prove that the unit suite cannot: before T3, an
//! `update-edge` rule LOADED CLEAN and died at its first admitted tick in
//! the collect path's refusal arm (the dossier's surprise 6). These run the
//! real load pipeline AND the real tick — the load-time gate
//! (`check_no_deferred_shape_verbs`) never covered `update-edge`, so the
//! full path from content to a moved tick hash is what's actually on trial.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Every expected value is DERIVED in its test's own comment and exact in
//! binary64 (dyadic rationals only — `edge_lane_e2e.rs`'s discipline): plain
//! `f64` equality is the right assertion throughout.
