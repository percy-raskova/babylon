//! Hyperedge-lane Task 3 (E1c, Community port train, plan
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-18-community-port.md`): the three §2.6
//! hyperedge query heads — `hyperedges`, `members-of`, `hyperedges-of` —
//! served by the query evaluator, plus the `Element::Hyperedge` cross-kind
//! Ord ruling.
//!
//! RED (this commit): each head is pinned refusing through BOTH tables —
//! `query::materialize`'s unserved-head refusal (query position) and
//! `evaluator`'s expression-position classifier (bare `<expr>` position).
//! The pins record the exact texts before they change meaning.
//!
//! NOTE on file placement (deviation, recorded): the plan's Task 3 names
//! `tests/hyperedge_lane_e2e.rs` (babylon-bsl); that file's harness only
//! loads scenarios, while these pins must drive the tick — they live here
//! beside Task 4's own tick-driver file, the seam the pins actually
//! exercise.
