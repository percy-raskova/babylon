//! Conformance vectors for `solidarity/p0-transmit` (the Solidarity @8.0
//! port train, frozen `src/babylon/engine/systems/solidarity.py`, issue
//! #557 umbrella) — `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-solidarity-port.md`.
//!
//! # Task 2 scope (values)
//!
//! Task 1 landed the loadable namespace and the conformance world
//! (`content/scenarios/solidarity-conformance.bscn`) behind a never-firing
//! PROBE rule. Task 2 replaced that probe with the real
//! `content/rules/solidarity.bsl` and pins the post-tick
//! `social-class/revolutionary` value on every witness target: the plain
//! transmission, the three MASS_AWAKENING-adjacent sub-cases (crossing,
//! staying below, landing exactly at the threshold — the latter checked by
//! BIT-EXACT equality against the `solidarity/mass-awakening-threshold`
//! `:const`, a Sterbenz's-lemma equality this task is the first to read
//! back rather than merely reason about), the three skip gates
//! (`strength <= 0`, source at/below `activation_threshold`,
//! `|delta| < negligible_transmission`), the multi-inbound last-write-wins
//! divergence (D-record 2: 0.478 frozen vs 0.31 ported), the inactive
//! -source and inactive-target skips, and the clamp's upper bound.
//!
//! # Task 3 scope (events)
//!
//! Task 3 (`.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-17-solidarity-port/task-3-brief.md`)
//! adds the two emits to `solidarity.bsl` and pins `sink.events` here:
//! `CONSCIOUSNESS_TRANSMISSION` on every applied transmission,
//! `MASS_AWAKENING` only on an upward crossing of the mass-awakening
//! threshold (the frozen chained comparison's asymmetric `<`/`<=` arms,
//! `solidarity.py:190`). The full nine-event ordered list is pinned by
//! exact `Value::NodeRef`/`Value::Real` payload equality, in the shape of
//! `vitality_conformance.rs::the_reaper_emits_one_entity_death_per_dissolution`;
//! the negative case (raises but does not cross 0.6) and the exact-0.6
//! boundary crossing each additionally get their own isolated assertion.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Values are hand-computed from `delta = strength * (source_r - target_r)`,
//! `new = clamp01(target_r + delta)` (plan §2.6), using FORWARD f64
//! arithmetic in the rule's own association order wherever a witness's
//! inputs are not exact dyadic rationals (the multi-inbound witness's
//! 0.9/0.8/0.1/0.3 seeds) — the same discipline
//! `vitality_conformance.rs::the_drain_scales_with_population_and_standard_of_living`
//! uses, for the same reason: hand-rounding a decimal literal risks a
//! transcription error unrelated to the port, where recomputing the exact
//! IEEE-754 expression the rule evaluates cannot diverge from it.
//!
//! # Task 4 scope (the dual-implementation oracle)
//!
//! Task 4 (`.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-17-solidarity-port/task-4-brief.md`)
//! adds `content/scenarios/solidarity_conformance.py` — a STANDALONE,
//! dependency-free Python script (no `babylon` import, no pytest) that
//! transcribes `solidarity.bsl`'s own binding order and collect-then-apply
//! semantics term-for-term over a literal `WORLD` dict matching this
//! `.bscn` node-for-node, seed-for-seed. **This is the oracle, not the
//! frozen engine** (ADR183 + D146 precedent): the frozen
//! `SolidaritySystem` applies each edge's delta sequentially, in place, so
//! literally rerunning it would print the multi-inbound witness's FROZEN
//! answer (0.478), not the port's own accepted answer (0.31, D-record 2).
//! Reconciled by hand against every literal pinned above and in
//! `tick_goldens.rs::solidarity_conformance_hashes_are_pinned`: every value
//! agrees exactly — no mismatch found in either implementation.
