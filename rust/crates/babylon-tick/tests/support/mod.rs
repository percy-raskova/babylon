//! Shared helpers for `babylon-tick`'s conformance test suite (theme 6,
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-18-bsl-refactor-program.md` §4 Task
//! R2.1).
//!
//! Lives at `tests/support/mod.rs` — Rust's own convention for an
//! integration-test helper module that is NOT itself compiled as a
//! separate test binary (unlike every sibling `tests/*.rs` file, a
//! `mod.rs` under a subdirectory is visible only to files that declare
//! `mod support;` themselves).
//!
//! **Genuinely-found shapes only.** `rust/crates/babylon-tick/tests/`
//! comprises 31 files (12,158 lines) sharing a `run_once_into`/
//! `CollectingSink`/`node_attribute` trio 315+ times, but NOT one
//! identical shape — direct reads found three distinct `attribute()`
//! signatures (a `MemoryGraph`-keyed-by-`u64` majority, e.g.
//! `dispossession_conformance.rs:74`; a `HypergraphStore`-keyed-by-`NodeId`
//! variant, e.g. `territory_conformance.rs:169`,
//! `control_ratio_conformance.rs:460`; and a `HypergraphStore`-keyed-by-
//! `u64` variant, `multi_rule_conformance.rs:146`), three distinct `run_*`
//! return shapes (below), and at least one independently-renamed pin-table
//! struct (`ExpectedTerritory` in `multi_rule_conformance.rs:71`, diffed
//! field-for-field against `lifecycle_conformance.rs:110`'s and
//! `lifecycle_crisis_conformance.rs:84`'s own `Expected` and confirmed
//! identical). Every item below generalizes from a genuinely repeated
//! shape, cited at its definition — nothing here forces a merge the source
//! files didn't already share.
//!
//! **Pure addition (R2.1.3).** Landing this module changes NOTHING about
//! the 31 existing files; sweeping them onto it is a named, explicitly
//! deferred follow-up past Checkpoint A — several are under active edit by
//! concurrent port trains this week, and touching them now would maximize
//! rebase conflict for a cosmetic win. `support_smoke_conformance.rs` is
//! this module's own adopter; `metabolism_entropy_high_conformance.rs` is
//! migrated onto it as the proof-of-adoption (mechanical, behavior-
//! identical — same fixture, same assertions, same pass/fail contract).
//!
//! `#![allow(dead_code)]` (CLAUDE.md rule 7 exemption, explicitly declared):
//! each `tests/*.rs` file that does `mod support;` compiles this module
//! into ITS OWN binary crate (Rust integration-test convention), so
//! dead-code analysis runs per-binary, not per-module. An item unused by
//! `metabolism_entropy_high_conformance.rs` (e.g. `ExpectedField`, which
//! that file's un-pin-tabled assertions never construct) is fully used by
//! `support_smoke_conformance.rs`; a per-binary `dead_code` lint cannot see
//! that, so it fires falsely at every partial adopter. This is the
//! standard, accepted shape for a Rust `tests/common/mod.rs`-style shared
//! helper module, not a suppressed real defect.
