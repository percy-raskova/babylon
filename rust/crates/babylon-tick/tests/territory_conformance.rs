//! Conformance vectors for the `territory/*` rule pack (P27 Phase 2, the
//! Territory port train — `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-12-territory-
//! port-plan.md`, PR B), taken from the frozen Python engine's live
//! behaviour.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Every STRUCTURAL claim below (which fields moved, in which direction,
//! the latch set, the sink chosen, the suppression set) was checked against
//! the frozen `TerritorySystem` running one `step()` over a fixture that
//! mirrors `content/scenarios/territory-conformance.bscn` node for node.
//! The command, from the repository root:
//!
//! ```text
//! PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" uv run python \
//!     rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/scenarios/territory_conformance.py
//! ```
//!
//! The frozen system is the contract source for STRUCTURE and ORDERING,
//! not a correctness oracle (ADR183) — the port train's own D-records
//! (`territory.bsl`'s header) name every place this pack's arithmetic
//! diverges from the frozen engine's operation SEQUENCE for the same
//! real-valued function (the scaled-Int rent lane, the pull-side spillover
//! fold, the directed-vs-any sink/spillover walks). Every NUMERIC value
//! pinned below is measured from the BSL engine's own output, never copied
//! from the frozen mirror's printed floats.
//!
//! # Scenario census (Task 3)
//!
//! Twelve territories, three social classes, eight edges (six ADJACENCY,
//! two TENANCY) — see `territory-conformance.bscn`'s own header for the
//! full per-node conformance-case map.
