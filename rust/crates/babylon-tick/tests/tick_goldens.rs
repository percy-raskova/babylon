//! Widens the tick-hash golden surface from ONE pinned end-to-end hash
//! (`babylon-client/tests/engine_link.rs`'s post-tick hash on
//! two-classes.bscn + fundamental-theorem.bsl) to SIX: pre- and post-tick,
//! on all THREE committed content pairs `babylon-tick`/`babylon-client`
//! ship (two single-rule pairs plus the B2 demo world's two-rule pair).
//! The pre-tick value for the first pair previously appeared only in prose
//! (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-11-hypergraph-storage-swap-plan.md`
//! Task 3); this is where it becomes an executable pin.
//!
//! This surface exists to catch the storage swap — or, for the third pair,
//! ANY unintentional drift in the shipped demo content or the two rule
//! packs it composes — moving a byte the single `engine_link` pin would
//! miss. A change that happened to leave the FINAL hash of ONE content
//! pair unmoved by coincidence would still move at least one of these six.
//! Mutation-proven (adversarial-panel finding FB4, this fix round):
//! tripling `us-counties-lifecycle-demo.bscn`'s county-01011 `pop-d`, and
//! a total-preserving recomposition of county-01001's `pop-d`/`pop-p`
//! (2042/5748 -> 2043/5747), both left every OTHER test in this crate and
//! `babylon-client` green — this golden is what catches either.
//!
//! Measured, never derived: every hash below was produced by running
//! `run_once` once against the committed content and reading the printed
//! value back — see the storage-swap plan, Phase A Task 3, Step 1, for the
//! first two pairs; the third pair's hashes were measured the same way at
//! this fix round's own tip (2026-08-11) and cross-confirmed against the
//! identical post-tick hash `tests/tick_loop.rs`'s own
//! `pressing_space_advances_the_tick_and_updates_the_hash_text` observes
//! through the client's independent `EngineSession` seam.
