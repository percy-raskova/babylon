# Specification Quality Checklist: Capital Volume III Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec references existing constrained types (Currency, Probability, Coefficient) and data patterns (NoDataSentinel, graph bridge) by name as domain concepts, not implementation details -- these are established project vocabulary.
- Seven user stories cover the full Volume III scope from foundational accounting (US1) through financial crisis integration (US6) and value basis conversion (US7).
- Assumptions section explicitly documents scope decisions (e.g., transformation problem out of scope, derivatives excluded from financialization index).
