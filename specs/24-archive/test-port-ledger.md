# Program 24 — The Archive: test-port ledger

**Scope:** every behavioral assertion the legacy web client's test estate makes,
mapped to the contract test that carries it after the cutover. Seeded at P1
(county scope); **full closure is a P4 cutover-gate criterion** (charter
criterion 1). Format follows the Program 12 precedent
(`specs/112-cutover/test-port-ledger.md`).

**Authority:** `project/programs/24-the-archive.md` (P1 item 1, P4 gate).
**Method:** dispositions per row — PORTED (test moved, asserts the same
behavior), REWRITTEN (behavior re-asserted against the projection contract),
RE-GUARDED (behavior now pinned by a registry/view contract test), CARRIED
(deferred to a named P2 lane), RETIRED (legacy-only behavior, dies with the
web client).

## Disposition counts (P1 seed + Lane E through WO-42 + Wave-1 WO-35)

| Disposition | Rows |
|---|---|
| PORTED | 9 |
| REWRITTEN | 11 |
| RE-GUARDED | 2 |
| CARRIED (P2) | 1 |
| CARRIED (P3) | 1 |
| RETIRED | 1 |

## engine_bridge full-closure counts (WO-52 — all 63 disabled classes)

All 63 `tests/unit/web/test_engine_bridge.py` classes are now dispositioned:
17 already carried by the Ledger rows above (rows 35–47), 46 added in the
`engine_bridge disposition` section below. `GAP` is the honest disposition for
engine/projection behavior that no new test covers and no in-flight WO owns —
these are the cutover blockers enumerated in the LOUD list.

| Disposition | Classes |
|---|---|
| PORTED (already in rows 35–47) | 17 |
| PORTED (new) | 10 |
| RE-GUARDED (new) | 3 |
| CARRIED — P3 (new) | 8 |
| RETIRED (new) | 21 |
| REWRITTEN (new — T3 U2 closure) | 2 |
| GAP — uncovered, unowned (new) | 2 |
| **Total** | **63** |

## Deviations recorded

- **No forced bridge delegation in WO-3.** The work-order draft named
  `web/game/engine_bridge.py::get_county_import_exposure` as a thin-shim
  delegation site; inspection shows it serves spec-103 *import-exposure
  provenance* — a different quantity than the `CountyView` dossier, so a
  delegation there would be cosmetic, not a real seam. The genuine Django
  shim landed with the fog relocate (WO-1: `web/game/fog/*` re-export shims,
  `is`-identity guarded by `tests/unit/web/test_fog_shim.py`). Bridge
  *inspection* reads are REWRITTEN rows above; the bridge keeps serving the
  legacy client untouched until P4 deletes it.
- The disabled `test_engine_bridge.py` suite (module-level skip, owner ruling
  2026-07-20) remains in-tree as the P4 closure worklist: at cutover, every
  one of its 63 test classes must appear in this ledger with a disposition.
  **CLOSED by WO-52** — see the `engine_bridge disposition` section below.
- **Row-35 economy mapping is narrower than its wording (WO-52 finding).** Rows 35
  map `TestGetEconomy`/`TestImperialRentGapByRegion` onto `test_county.py`'s
  per-county `imperial_rent_phi` (`tick_phi_hour`). That is the Leontief-tensor Φ
  read straight off a territory attribute — a **different quantity** from the
  legacy classes' graph-wide `value_produced`/`rent_extracted`/`exploitation_rate`
  aggregation over `social_class` wealth + EXPLOITATION/WAGES edges and the
  population-weighted per-capita Wc−Vc breakdown. The per-county Φ reading is
  genuinely REWRITTEN; the **graph-aggregate economy quantities are NOT projected
  anywhere** and surface in the LOUD gap list below (`TestEconomyDashboardFundamentalTheorem`,
  `TestEconomyDashboardChipContract`). Existing rows are left intact per the
  no-delete rule; this note records the scope gap.
- **`first-session.spec.ts` and `event-popup.spec.ts` had no ledger row (WO-52
  closure-sentinel finding).** Building the mechanical sentinel test
  (`tests/unit/archive/test_ledger_closed.py`) enumerates every
  `src/frontend/e2e/*.spec.ts` filename and found these two absent from every
  prior WO-52 pass. Neither hid an unowned behavior: `first-session.spec.ts`'s
  legs are each already covered by rows/classes landed under other WOs (its
  epilogue leg is even cited BY NAME in `test_epilogues.py`'s own docstring,
  WO-34), and `event-popup.spec.ts` is purely legacy React toast-rail UI with
  its own frontend unit tests. Both appended as rows above rather than
  weakening the sentinel's containment check.

## engine_bridge disposition (WO-52)

Full closure of the 63 disabled `tests/unit/web/test_engine_bridge.py` classes.
Method: for each class, the **behavior** it pins (not its mock choreography) was
traced to a landed new test, an in-flight P3/P4 work order, a standing gate, or
judged legacy-web-only. Branch scanned: `feature/archive-p2-p4 @ 5474c44e`
(P2 Waves 1/1b/2 + Lane E WO-38…44 landed; P3 WO-46…50 + P4 WO-51…53 in flight).

| `TestVerbEligibilityAgreesWithTargetsRealWayneCounty` | eligibility agrees verb-by-verb with the target lists on the real graph | `build_verb_plate` unifies eligibility with the target-existence predicates (one source of truth → the disagreement bug class is structurally eliminated), `verbs/test_plate.py` | PORTED (WO-38) |
| `TestBuildTickSummarySeriesAggregates` | county-deduped, population-weighted tick_* aggregates (no N-fold inflation, extensive-sum-once-per-county) | `projection/national.py` pop-weighted county rollup + `test_national.py::test_unattributed_territory_does_not_skew_the_rollup` (same intensive-aggregation-variance discipline) | PORTED (WO-17) |
| `TestEconomyDashboardVeil` | value-axis fields masked below doctrine Veil Tier 1, real at Tier 1+ | veil mechanism PORTED `projection/veil.py` + `test_veil_gating.py`; **no economy payload consumes it yet** (tied to the economy-dashboard GAP below) | PORTED (WO-41) |
| `TestDefixturedQueryCorrectness` | queries read correct node TYPES/attrs/enums (social_class≠community; no `territory_ids` on social_class; real declared fields) | `mise run check:vocabulary` (3-rule vocabulary sentinel) is the exact standing guard for this bug class; extraction_intensity/edge_mode economy reads fold into the economy GAP | RE-GUARDED |
| `TestCausalHeartbeatWiring` | per-session observer emits a TICK_PULSE frame each tick | frame emission RE-GUARDED `tests/unit/engine/observers/test_causal_chain.py::TestFrameCaptureApi`; per-session cache + NarrationRecord persistence = web Voice-heartbeat → Archive analogue is the WO-42 narrator cache | RE-GUARDED |

| `TestGetMapHistory` | map-lens scrubber: metric taxonomy (unknown/not_replayable), window cap, veil-0 masking | web map-lens time-scrubber; per-tick history is the baked vault git log (WO-44/51); map room WO-33 renders current-tick | RETIRED |
| `TestHexFeaturePropertiesHabitability` | per-hex habitability read from an `attributes` JSONB blob, honest None | web per-hex map-lens; habitability stays a live engine attr (MetabolismSystem, read by endgame/balkanization); `v_hex_state_asof` (WO-33) has a fixed column set (no attributes blob) | RETIRED |

| `TestBridgeEconomicsOverridesWiresCirculationAndFinancialServices` | `_bridge_economics_overrides` wires FRED circulation/financial services | web-bridge-local DUPLICATE of the headless-runner wiring (`domain/economics/factory.py`); Archive runs the engine via the runner; durable behavior covered by `tests/unit/economics/test_create_financial_services.py` + `tests/integration/test_circulation_one_tick.py` | RETIRED |

### LOUD — coverage gaps the main loop must close before cutover

Engine/projection behavior that (a) no landed test covers, (b) no in-flight WO
clearly owns. These block the WO-52 cutover gate:

1. **CLOSED (T3 U2).** ~~`TestEconomyDashboardFundamentalTheorem` → graph-wide
   Wc−Vc imperial-rent gap + per-region population-weighted per-capita
   breakdown.~~ Closed by `babylon.projection.economy.project_economy` — the
   verdict reads `opposition_states["wage"].balance` verbatim (never a
   parallel Φ) plus the `fundamental_theorem` graph stash's per-class Φ
   readings. Row 35's `tick_phi_hour` remains a distinct quantity (per-county
   Leontief Φ, not the Fundamental Theorem) — the reconciling note that scope
   boundary still stands. See row 191 above.
2. **CLOSED (T3 U2).** ~~`TestEconomyDashboardChipContract` → economy
   aggregate quantities.~~ The chip key-SET contract itself was web-shape and
   retires with the web client; the underlying aggregates are now the
   economy dossier's Volume III surplus split (`s = p + i + r + t`, extensive
   ratio-of-sums) + metabolic matter-book (`overshoot_ratio`,
   `biocapacity_ceiling`) — `wealth_by_class_role`/`county_flow` specifically
   have no successor (no `FactionView`/per-role rollup exists; not this
   unit's scope). See row 192 above.
3. **CLOSED (T3 U3).** ~~`TestGetFieldState` → dialectical field-stack /
   "Weather Layer" projection.~~ Closed by
   `babylon.projection.field_state.project_field_state` — a direct port of
   `EngineBridge.get_field_state`'s read logic (`contradiction_fields`,
   `field_derivatives` laplacian/df_dt only, `fascist_alignment`,
   TENANCY-anchored `field_gradients`, graph-level `principal_field`/
   `dialectical_regime`) into a pure projection read-model, singleton page
   `field_state/USA.md` (`ArchiveTickBaker`/`IncrementalArchiveTickBaker`
   dispatch). See row 194 above.
4. **`TestBalkanizationMapFields` → faction enumeration + contested-territory
   derivation.** spec-070 balkanization (factions, INFLUENCES influence_level,
   per-territory contested/dominant_faction) feeds RED_SETTLER_TRAP / secession.
   Single-sovereign CLAIMS is projected; the faction/contested half is not, and no
   WO owns it. **Owner needed: NEW balkanization projection, or extend map-room WO-33.**

Secondary / borderline (surface for a ruling, not hard cutover blockers):
- **Event→territory anchoring** (`TestSerializeEventUprisingTerritoryAnchoring`,
  anchoring half of `TestReactionaryVerbSeverityAndAnchoring`) — CARRIED to WO-48,
  but WO-48's charter (salience/dedup/autopause) does not explicitly name event
  enrichment; confirm WO-48 absorbs it or open a sub-task. The TENANCY-inversion
  primitive is already alive in `verbs/plate.py`.
- **Per-hex `habitability`** (`TestHexFeaturePropertiesHabitability`) — RETIRED as a
  web map-lens, but the ecological-overshoot signal is not surfaced in any TUI hex
  projection (`v_hex_state_asof` has no habitability column). Confirm this is an
  intentional map-lens omission, not a dropped signal.

## WO-50 — Pilot e2e (first-session trunk spine → the Archive seams)

The cutover gate #2 acceptance evidence: the legacy web trunk e2e
`src/frontend/e2e/first-session.spec.ts` (483 lines) ported behavior-not-selectors
onto the Archive stack (engine + projection + TUI pure logic; the web client is
never imported). One test per hard-asserted sub-behavior in
`tests/integration/archive/test_pilot_first_action.py`.

| first-session.spec.ts leg (lines) | Archive test | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| lobby shows generated codenames, no unnamed rows (100–116) | `test_lobby_every_catalog_row_carries_a_derived_codename` | REWRITTEN (real `BabylonMetaStore`/`CampaignMenu` over `pg_pool`; row codename == `operation_codename(campaign_id)`) |
| briefing: five patterns, win condition, fixed century horizon (118–158) | `test_briefing_five_patterns_win_condition_and_century_horizon` | REWRITTEN (`project_briefing`/`render_briefing`; "100 years" + "Century" copy; honest 0.0 progress on a fresh campaign) |
| Campaign: preview (prob + cost) before submit, submit succeeds (223–259) | `test_verb_preview_precedes_submit_then_the_engine_adjudicates` | PORTED (from `test_verb_resolution.py`; preview_verb → submit_verb → OODASystem adjudicates; EDUCATE is the affordable eligible verb in the OODA-minimal fixture the web's Campaign maps to) |
| (verb write-side rejection half of the plate contract) | `test_unaffordable_verb_is_refused_before_the_engine` | PORTED (from `test_verb_resolution.py`) |
| forced first crisis autopauses + acknowledged live (261–304) | `test_forced_endgame_crisis_autopauses_amber_then_ack_clears` | REWRITTEN (`classify_event_salience`/`compute_autopause_state`/`render_autopause_indicator` + pilot-loop Step gate + ack-clears) |
| no two consecutive identical event cards; volume floors (319–350) | `test_event_dedup_and_volume_floors_over_real_tick_events` | REWRITTEN (real engine tick → `dedupe_consecutive`/`apply_volume_floors`; test-local engine→ChronicleEvent adapter — see gap 1) |
| endgame_progress axes render honestly, none pinned 1.00 (352–362) | `test_objective_progress_after_two_real_ticks_never_pinned` | REWRITTEN (two real ticks → real `EndgameDetector.axis_progress()` → `journal_objectives`; none == 1.0) |
| epilogue: real horizon termination → UNRESOLVED, exact copy (365–439) | `test_rigged_horizon_crosses_into_the_unresolved_epilogue` | REWRITTEN (rigged `campaign_horizon_years=1`/`weeks_per_year=1`; one real tick; `endgame_status` crosses; body byte-equal to `EPILOGUES["unresolved"]`) |
| terminal-state: further resolve succeeds, persisted epilogue immutable (441–482) | `test_terminal_epilogue_is_stable_across_a_further_tick` | REWRITTEN (further real tick resolves — no engine refusal gate; outcome/epilogue stable; see gap 4) |

### WO-50 honest gaps (load-bearing — surfaced to the BD, never faked)

1. **No shipped engine→Chronicle feed.** `babylon.tui.chronicle` is fixture-fed by
   construction; the dedup leg reshapes REAL bus events into `ChronicleEvent` via a
   test-local adapter (`_chronicle_events_from_bus`). Events real, dedup/floor logic
   real; the production adapter is a **future WO**.
2. **Narrative-cap floor vacuous in-process.** The minimal in-process scenario emits
   only warning-tier events (`lifecycle_transition` + `organizational_action`), so the
   informational-tier per-tick cap holds but caps nothing. The ORGANIZATIONAL_ACTION
   aggregation floor IS exercised live. A future WO wiring the headless wayne run into
   the Chronicle feed exercises the informational cap against real informational events.
3. **`endgame_reached` is critical but NOT the sole critical tier.** The web re-tiered
   critical to endgame-only (FR-116-2); the ported `EVENT_SEVERITY` keeps the full
   spec-061 taxonomy (14 critical types). endgame_reached is critical + drives autopause,
   but not uniquely so in the Archive — a divergence to rule on.
4. **Pure endgame fold is memoryless.** `endgame_status` recomputes each tick; the web's
   "first ENDGAME_REACHED row is authoritative" immutability (`ORDER BY tick ASC LIMIT 1`)
   is a persistence guarantee absent from the pure projection. The terminal-state leg's
   stability holds because the material state never crosses into a pattern; a future WO
   must persist the first endgame event to lock the outcome against a LATER pattern.
5. **No autopause-acknowledgement state machine.** `chronicle_salience` omits the
   once-per-key ack layer (WO-46 `babylon_meta`); the crisis leg models ack as the pilot
   dropping the acknowledged critical event from the surfaced slice.
