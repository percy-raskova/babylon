"""beast_engine — the pulsating capitalist death engine at idle (entity suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF (#641):
The persistent bed under menus and idle screens: the beast never stops feeding.
Two pads state the same E drone, one riding a constant +35-cent bend, so the
bed's fundamental beats against itself — the machine is out of tune with
itself and never resolves. Seven organ voices (#639's organ map — the six
body organs plus the mask's glint — one per MIDI
channel — the channel↔organ binding is a cue-map CONTRACT) cycle at coprime
periods (16, 17, 23, 29, 31, 43, 47) so the surface never repeats, while a
strict 4-beat mechanical pulse holds the grid rigid underneath: the pulse is
the only honest thing in the piece. The breath is asymmetric — a 10-beat
inhale against a 6-beat exhale — so the organism always sounds like it is
over-feeding. Circulation idles on D–A–D and never PLAYS the F: the Φ motif
is gestured melodically, never completed. The F sounds in the piece only in
the body's OTHER organs — the nervous system's F2 tremolo grind and the
tissue's E3+F3 membrane cluster — and in six of the fourteen circulation
cycles one of them sounds under the idling D–A. In those bars the surplus
note is PRESENT AS TENSION, carried by the field and the flesh, never
collected as melody. That is the deliberate harmonic reading: the beast
cannot play its own surplus; it can only ache where the surplus would be.
The mask (channel 8, vibraphone) only glints here — a distant pure fifth every
47 beats; its full consonant surface lives in the_mask (Director-ruled Arm A).

INTENSITY GOVERNOR (menu-safe discipline, #641 Gate 5 — controller-adjudicated
under the Director's compass delegation, 2026-08-18): the bed's intensity is
governed by Φ, the imperial-rent pool — the beast's loudness IS its feeding
rate, so disrupting Φ audibly starves the machine. Assets ship one intensity;
the ladder is the (parked) mixer's contract, recorded in src/assets/CUE_MAP.md.

TECHNICAL: 60 BPM, 4/4, ~240 beats ≈ 4:00, loop-seamed (CC11 returns to its
beat-0 value; the final drone breath abuts beat 0). Warm Pad 89 (body),
New Age Pad 88 (the detuned twin, +35 ¢ ≈ bend +239), Timpani 47 (heartbeat),
Fretless 35 (circulation), Breath Noise 121 (metabolism), Choir 52 (tissue),
Tremolo Strings 44 (nervous system — F2 floor), Xylophone 13 (skeleton),
Vibraphone 11 (the mask's glint), percussion (kick/hat) as the grid.
