"""dissection — the beast taken apart and put back together (entity suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF (#641):
The exploded-view companion (#639 organ 8 — dissection is the interaction,
not a voice): each of the SEVEN sounding organs states its own material ALONE,
in the fixed order of the organ list, for sixteen bare beats inside an
eighteen-beat slot — a listener learns which timbre is which — then they
re-enter cumulatively in the same order, and the piece ends with the full
bed, drone, twin-detune and grid included: audibly MORE WRONG assembled than
any part was alone. That is the thesis. The pathology is relational; no organ
carries it by itself.

The mask (organ 7, vibraphone — Director-ruled Arm A) IS dissected here: its
solo is the last one you learn, a pure fifth glinting alone — and learning to
pick that voice out of the bed is exactly what makes toggling to the ticker
land as a lifting of the veil.

The channel↔organ binding is the same CONTRACT as beast_engine (cue-map row:
"solo organ N" in the client is a mixer operation on bed channel N; this track
is the reference recording for which timbre is which).

TECHNICAL: 60 BPM, 4/4, 206 beats ≈ 3:26. Solos at 18·k for k in 0..6;
cumulative re-entry at 126 + 10·k; the body (pads + grid) enters at 196 and
the piece ends assembled. Programs identical to beast_engine: Timpani 47,
Fretless 35, Breath Noise 121, Choir 52, Tremolo Strings 44 (F2 floor),
Xylophone 13, Vibraphone 11, Warm Pad 89 + New Age Pad 88 (+35-cent twin),
percussion grid. All note generation is fixed-count `for` loops — the count
per section is stated at the call site, per the house loop-bound rule.
