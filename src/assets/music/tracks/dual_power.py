"""dual_power — RED_OGV (endgame suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF:
Sovereignty, contested to the last bar. A contrabass B — the dominant of E,
the note that WANTS to resolve — pedals through the entire piece with a
timpani heartbeat, and never resolves. Above it, two musics alternate: the
red arrival (brass and choir, E major, warm and wide) and the old state
(harpsichord arpeggios and organ, F major — one poisoned semitone above
the pedal's home). Their entries begin politely separated, then the gap
closes: six beats, four, two, touching, overlapping — until both sound AT
ONCE, E major against F major over the B pedal, the loudest and densest
moment of the piece: interpenetration without synthesis. Both release; the
pedal hums on alone with its heartbeat; a final timpani stroke. Neither
yields. Victory with an asterisk, at soundtrack length.

TECHNICAL: 92 BPM, 4/4, ~180 beats ≈ 1:57. Contrabass 43 + Timpani 47 (the
pedal), Brass 61 + Choir 52 (red), Harpsichord 6 + Rock Organ 19 (the old
state).
