"""history_breathing — the world map at rest (ambient suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF:
The menu/idle music the estate never had: "the world map — history breathing."
Five voices cycle at COPRIME periods (16, 17, 23, 31, 47 beats), so no two
phrases ever realign inside the piece — a generative, never-repeating surface
from fully deterministic material. The pad inhales and exhales on a 16-beat
breath; the harp turns a 17-beat wheel; strings shade Dorian hope on a
23-beat cycle; the piano Observer speaks every 31 beats; and every 47 beats
the cello sounds just the first interval of the Phi motif (D–A) — the engine
of history idling under the map. Twice, at prime-numbered minutes, a flute
overflies. E Dorian: darkness with the raised sixth of possibility.

TECHNICAL: 60 BPM, 4/4, ~244 beats ≈ 4:04. Warm Pad 89 (breath), Strings 48,
Harp 46, Piano 0, Cello 42, Flute 73. High shared reverb (the map is vast);
spatial spread: harp left, piano right, cello just left of centre.
