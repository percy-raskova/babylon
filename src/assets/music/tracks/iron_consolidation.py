"""iron_consolidation — FASCIST_CONSOLIDATION (endgame suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF:
False order at full length. Brass, strings and organ hammer the same
Phrygian line in strict unison across three octaves — conformity given
mass — over timpani, taiko and a regimented snare, chorus zero, in a dry
airless room. At the centre, the machine idles and a SOLO VIOLIN plays the
solidarity call from the revolutionary suite... and nothing answers. Four
beats of percussion where the response should be. It tries once more,
smaller. Silence again — the atomized nation cannot answer a call; that is
the whole diagnosis in eight beats. The column returns larger (a tuba
octave below), marches to the end of the harmony, and then the FULL
percussion machine — snare included — keeps marching, bar after identical
bar, and is cut mid-pattern. The machine does not resolve; it is
interrupted.

TECHNICAL: 104 BPM, 4/4, ~174 beats ≈ 1:40. Brass 61, Strings 48, Rock
Organ 19, Tuba 58, Violin 40, Timpani 47, Taiko 116, snare/kick on ch 9.
