"""overshoot — O = C/B > 1 (rift suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF:
The metabolic rift as rhythm. Regeneration is a gentle 9-beat cycle sung by
three biocapacity voices — strings, harp, choir. Consumption is a driving
7-beat piano figure with a kick under it. Seven against nine: they phase,
almost together, then apart — sustainable tension. Then consumption
ACCELERATES: its period contracts to six beats, then five, while
regeneration CANNOT speed up (that is the whole tragedy of ecology). At
every lap — each time consumption overtakes a regeneration cycle — a
timpani strike lands and ONE BIOCAPACITY VOICE FALLS SILENT: first the
choir, then the harp, then the strings thin, then nothing regrows at all.
The consumption figure hammers on alone, loses notes cycle by cycle —
a machine stuttering on an empty tank — and stops on two isolated strikes.
Ecological overshoot does not end with a bang; it ends with the last
withdrawal from an account nothing refills.

TECHNICAL: 100 BPM, 4/4, ~240 beats ≈ 2:24. Piano 0 + kick (consumption);
Strings 48, Harp 46, Choir 52 (regeneration); Timpani 47 (the laps).
