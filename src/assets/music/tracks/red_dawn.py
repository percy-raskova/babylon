"""red_dawn — REVOLUTIONARY_VICTORY (endgame suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF:
The one full resolution in the estate, and it settles an eight-year-old
debt: the Phi theme has always ended on the dominant A — "unresolved,
waiting". Here the waiting ends — and the transformation is AUDIBLE,
because the untransformed motif is stated first: twice under the struggle,
the cello grinds the original D–A–D–F beneath the solidarity
call-and-response and the accelerating timpani roll. After the break into
E major and a hymn whose trumpet descant genuinely climbs pass by pass,
the coda re-states the motif — and the F, the surplus note, tries ONCE to
enter and is cut off mid-attack; from then on the loop runs D–A–D–A,
extraction closed on itself. The bass holds the old dominant one last
time... and resolves to E. The final sonority keeps its promises the hard
way: the top voices are an OPEN fifth-and-octave (E5–B5–E6, no third), the
third lives only down in the brass, a flat-seventh D smoulders in the
middle of the chord (triumph with the grit still in it — the work is only
now possible), and the root is planted in the cello's E2.

TECHNICAL: 112 BPM, 4/4, ~184 beats ≈ 1:39. Cello 42, Violin 40, Brass 61,
Choir 52, Trumpet 56, Tremolo 44, Glockenspiel 9, Timpani 47, Orch Hit 55.
