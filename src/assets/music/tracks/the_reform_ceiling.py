"""the_reform_ceiling — the PASOK bleed as musical form (superstructure suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF:
P25's reform ceiling and constant-ratio bleed, composed literally — with
counter-motion. A hopeful five-note ascent states itself twelve times, each
cycle transposed ONE SEMITONE HIGHER — reform always reaching upward — while
its velocity bleeds by a constant ratio (×0.94 per cycle: slow enough that
the theme survives to be deformed). There is a CEILING: any pitch that would
cross C5 is REFLECTED back down (p → 144 − p), so from cycle four onward the
ascent audibly flattens into a rise-and-fall arch — climbing and collapsing
in the same gesture. And the room fights back: the ceiling rings as a
TRITONE DYAD (C5+F#5 — the ceiling is not a note, it is a wrongness) that
strikes HARDER each cycle as the theme weakens, while the contrabass floor
rises underneath it. The theme also drifts progressively off key against
the floor, which never transposes: by the late cycles the reformer is
playing in a key the room no longer contains. The outro is the ceiling
ringing its tritone over the loudest floor note in the piece. The geometry
was the message; the geometry is dissonant.

TECHNICAL: 84 BPM, 4/4, ~166 beats ≈ 2:00. Piano 0 (the reformer), Strings
48 (the base, echoing fainter), Tubular Bells 14 (the ceiling, tritone),
Contrabass 43 (the floor, rising). First fold at cycle 4.
