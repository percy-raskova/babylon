"""the_silent_spring — the fading of the living world (rift suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF:
After overshoot, the quieter piece: not the crash but the thinning. A flute
sings birdsong fragments over a vast pad — and each fragment is SHORTER
than the last: seven notes, then six, five, four, two, and finally a single
note cut off mid-breath, exposed against a deliberately hushed swell. Three
string chords pass a register above the pad like seasons, each barer and
each WRONGER than the last — a true minor triad, then a lydian-flat smear
(C, E, F#, B: the season comes back with the wrong notes in it), then an
empty fifth. The landscape never goes fully silent until the end — the pad
entries overlap the gaps so the game never reads as hung — but from beat
140 the ground itself detunes in a continuous flatward slide while the
light fades. The last sound in the world is a single triangle stroke: one
drop of water. The final silence is not the absence of the piece; it is
the piece.

TECHNICAL: 56 BPM, 4/4, ~168 beats ≈ 3:00. Flute 73, Warm Pad 89,
Strings 48, triangle on ch 9. Reverb very high — an emptying landscape.
