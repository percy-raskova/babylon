"""tribute_bleed — extraction heard as bleeding (entity suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF (#641):
The unequal-exchange velocity transfer turned vertical: a warm human voice
(choir over low strings) and a cold machine voice (the estate's harpsichord)
exchange a fixed loudness budget by the symmetric ±11-per-round rule — five
rounds, the human phrase stated 11 points quieter each time as the machine's
WRONG copy grows 11 points louder. The copy is a mis-transcription (two of its
eight notes shifted a semitone, the `_MISCOPIED` device) and it RUSHES — the
machine states the phrase in three-quarter time because it does not breathe.
Under every round the string body is drawn down a four-point glide: at each
round's entry the wheel resets shallow — the body keeps trying to rise — and
is pulled to a floor 344 units deeper than the last (−1024 at the first
round's floor to −2400 at the fifth's; the coda holds −2570, the deepest of
all). The value does not merely get quieter as it is drawn off, it goes FLAT
as it leaves — and it never gets back to pitch. CC93 solidarity falls with
it, and the bend makes the flattening audible. Coda: the giver breaks off
mid-phrase and is left as one low string at velocity 38 while the taker loops
its copy twice, intact, at 102.

Cue binding (non-event): the Φ / tribute lens, the imperial-rent view, any
sustained extraction-focused screen — see src/assets/CUE_MAP.md.

TECHNICAL: 60 BPM, 4/4, ~161 beats ≈ 2:41. Choir 52 (the voice), Strings 48
(the body), Harpsichord 6 (the machine), low tom (the ledger's drum turn).
Human panned centre-left, machine hard right — the geography of the transfer.
