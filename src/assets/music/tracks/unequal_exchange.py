"""unequal_exchange — the sigma-gradient, audible (periphery suite).

CONCEPTUAL BRIEF:
The planned-but-never-built "periphery lament", grounded in the Spectrum of
Unequal Exchange. A modal D-Mixolydian melody lives on the LEFT of the
stereo field — sitar and shanai, richly ornamented, human — over a taiko
heartbeat. After each statement, the RIGHT side answers with the SAME
melody, stripped and pressed down into the ledger's register: ornaments
gone, rhythm stiffened, harpsichord and muted trumpet — and MIS-TRANSCRIBED:
two of its notes are copied a semitone wrong, and stay wrong in every
round. The copy is not the song; it is the invoice. Round by round,
velocity TRANSFERS — the periphery states its phrase 11 points quieter as
the core's wrong copy grows 11 points louder. In the coda the periphery
breaks off mid-phrase; the core keeps looping its off-key copy and drifts
from the right edge INTO THE CENTRE — the wrong version becomes "the"
version. Then, at last, alone: one low sitar D at the edge of hearing,
with nothing left to accompany it.

TECHNICAL: 88 BPM, 4/4, ~258 beats ≈ 2:56. Sitar 104 + Shanai 111 (pan
20/28), Harpsichord 6 + Muted Trumpet 59 (pan 100/108), Taiko 116 (pan 24).
