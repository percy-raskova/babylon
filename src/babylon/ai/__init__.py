"""AI layer for narrative generation and game mastering.

This package contains the Ideological Superstructure - AI components
that observe the simulation but cannot modify its state.

The key principle: AI components are observers, not controllers.
They generate narrative from state changes but never influence
the Material Base (simulation mechanics).

Components:
- NarrativeDirector: AI Game Master that observes and narrates
