    ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` cannot be changed once the interpreter has started —
    CPython reads it exactly once, at start-up, to seed ``str``/``bytes``/
    ``datetime`` hash randomization — and the shipped launcher never set it
    (adversarial finding 3, ``ai/_inbox/PROGRAM_v1_0_0_playable_archive.md``
    spine G). The only way to pin it for a process that already exists is to
    replace that process image with a fresh interpreter that has the
    variable pre-set: an :func:`os.execve` re-exec. It also pins the BLAS/
    OpenMP thread caps to ``1`` — the same pin ``tests/conftest.py`` and
    ``tests/unit/test_blas_thread_cap.py`` already enforce for the test
    suite (deterministic FP reduction order, Constitution III.7; see the
    dev-box-freeze history in ``CLAUDE.md``) — so a real ``babylon play``
    run gets the identical single-threaded, byte-identical arithmetic the
    test suite already proves, not just the tests.

    Guarded two ways so it fires **at most once** per process tree:

    - ``BABYLON_ENV_SEALED`` is set only on the re-exec'd process's own
      environment, so that process always takes this function's early
      return and never re-execs again — a single, statically-bounded
      transition (unsealed -> exec -> sealed), not an unbounded loop.
    - ``sys.modules`` already containing ``pytest`` skips the re-exec
      entirely. Under the test harness this package is imported in-process
      many times over (``CliRunner``, ``from babylon.cli import app`` in
      ``tests/unit/cli/test_app.py`` et al.); replacing the pytest worker's
      own process image mid-collection would restart test collection
      instead of exercising a subcommand. The real launch path (the
      installed ``babylon`` script, or a subprocess a test spawns
      deliberately — see ``tests/unit/cli/test_launcher_reexec.py``) never
      has ``pytest`` imported, so this guard never fires there.
