Colonial domination, because it is total and tends to over-simplify,
very soon manages to disrupt in spectacular fashion the cultural
life of a conquered people. This cultural obliteration is made
possible by the negation of national reality, by new legal relations
introduced by the occupying power, by the banishment of the natives
and their customs to outlying districts by colonial society, by
expropriation, and by the systematic enslaving of men and women.

Three years ago at our first congress I showed that, in the colonial
situation, dynamism is replaced fairly quickly by a substantification
of the attitudes of the colonising power. The area of culture
is then marked off by fences and signposts. These are in fact
so many defence mechanisms of the most elementary type, comparable
for more than one good reason to the simple instinct for preservation.
The interest of this period for us is that the oppressor does
not manage to convince himself of the objective non-existence
of the oppressed nation and its culture. Every effort is made
to bring the colonised person to admit the inferiority of his
culture which has been transformed into instinctive patterns of
behaviour, to recognise the unreality of his 'nation', and, in
the last extreme, the confused and imperfect character of his
own biological structure.

*Vis-à-vis* this state of affairs, the native's reactions
are not unanimous While the mass of the people maintain intact
traditions which are completely different from those of the colonial
situation, and the artisan style solidifies into a formalism which
is more and more stereotyped, the intellectual throws himself
in frenzied fashion into the frantic acquisition of the culture
of the occupying power and takes every opportunity of unfavourably
criticising his own national culture, or else takes refuge in
setting out and substantiating the claims of that culture in a
way that is passionate but rapidly becomes unproductive.

The common nature of these two reactions lies in the fact that
they both lead to impossible contradictions. Whether a turncoat
or a substantialist the native is ineffectual precisely because
the analysis of the colonial situation is not carried out on strict
lines. The colonial situation calls a halt to national culture
in almost every field. Within the framework of colonial domination
there is not and there will never be such phenomena as new cultural
departures or changes in the national culture. Here and there
valiant attempts are sometimes made to reanimate the cultural
dynamic and to give fresh impulses to its themes, its forms and
its tonalities. The immediate, palpable and obvious interest of
such leaps ahead is nil. But if we follow up the consequences
to the very end we see that preparations are being thus made to
brush the cobwebs off national consciousness to question oppression
and to open up the struggle for freedom.

A national culture under colonial domination is a contested culture
whose destruction is sought in systematic fashion. It very quickly
becomes a culture condemned to secrecy. This idea of clandestine
culture is immediately seen in the reactions of the occupying
power which interprets attachment to traditions as faithfulness
to the spirit of the nation and as a refusal to submit. This persistence
in following forms of culture which are already condemned to extinction
is already a demonstration of nationality; but it is a demonstration
which is a throw-back to the laws of inertia. There is no taking
of the offensive and no redefining of relationships. There is
simply a concentration on a hard core of culture which is becoming
more and more shrivelled up, inert and empty.

By the time a century or two of exploitation has passed there
comes about a veritable emaciation of the stock of national culture.
It becomes a set of automatic habits, some traditions of dress and
a few broken-down institutions. Little movement can be discerned
in such remnants of culture; there is no real creativity and no
overflowing life. The poverty of the people, national oppression
and the inhibition of culture are one and the same thing. After
a century of colonial domination we find a culture which is rigid
in the extreme, or rather what we find are the dregs of culture,
its mineral strata. The withering away of the reality of the nation
and the death-pangs of the national culture are linked to each
other in mutual dependences. This is why it is of capital importance
to follow the evolution of these relations during the struggle
for national freedom. The negation of the native's culture, the
contempt for any manifestation of culture whether active or emotional
and the placing outside the pale of all specialised branches of
organisation contribute to breed aggressive patterns of conduct
in the native. But these patterns of conduct are of the reflexive
type; they are poorly differentiated, anarchic and ineffective.
Colonial exploitation, poverty and endemic famine drive the native
more and more to open, organised revolt. The necessity for an
open and decisive breach is formed progressively and imperceptibly,
and comes to be felt by the great majority of the people. Those
tensions which hitherto were non-existent come into being. International
events, the collapse of whole sections of colonial empires and
the contradictions inherent in the colonial system strengthen
and uphold the native's combativity while promoting and giving
support to national consciousness.

These new-found tensions which are present at all stages in the
real nature of colonialism have their repercussions on the cultural
plane. In literature, for example, there is relative over-production.
From being a reply on a minor scale to the dominating power, the
literature produced by natives becomes differentiated and makes
itself into a will to particularism. The intelligentsia, which
during the period of repression was essentially a consuming public,
now themselves become producers. This literature at first chooses
to confine itself to the tragic and poetic style; but later on
novels, short stories and essays are attempted. It is as if a
kind of internal organisation or law of expression existed which
wills that poetic expression become less frequent in proportion
as the objectives and the methods of the struggle for liberation
become more precise. Themes are completely altered; in fact, we
find less and less of bitter, hopeless recrimination and less
also of that violent, resounding, florid writing which on the
whole serves to reassure the occupying power. The colonialists
have in former times encouraged these modes of expression and
made their existence possible. Stinging denunciations, the exposing
of distressing conditions and passions which find their outlet
in expression are in fact assimilated by the occupying power in
a cathartic process. To aid such processes is in a certain sense
to avoid their dramatisation and to clear the atmosphere. But
such a situation can only be transitory. In fact, the progress
of national consciousness among the people modifies and gives
precision to the literary utterances of the native intellectual.
The continued cohesion of the people constitutes for the intellectual
an invitation to go farther than his cry of protest. The lament
first makes the indictment; then it makes an appeal. In the period
that follows, the words of command are heard. The crystallisation
of the national consciousness will both disrupt literary styles
and themes, and also create a completely new public. While at
the beginning the native intellectual used to produce his work
to be read exclusively by the oppressor, whether with the intention
of charming him or of denouncing him through ethnical or subjectivist
means, now the native writer progressively takes on the habit
of addressing his own people.

It is only from that moment that we can speak of a national literature.
Here there is, at the level of literary creation, the taking up
and clarification of themes which are typically nationalist. This
may be properly called a literature of combat, in the sense that
it calls on the whole people to fight for their existence as a
nation. It is a literature of combat, because it moulds the national
consciousness, giving it form and contours and flinging open before
it new and boundless horizons; it is a literature of combat because
it assumes responsibility, and because it is the will to liberty
expressed in terms of time and space.

On another level, the oral tradition - stories, epics and songs
of the people - which formerly were filed away as set pieces are
now beginning to change. The storytellers who used to relate inert
episodes now bring them alive and introduce into them modifications
which are increasingly fundamental. There is a tendency to bring
conflicts up to date and to modernise the kinds of struggle which
the stories evoke, together with the names of heroes and the types
of weapons. The method of allusion is more and more widely used.
The formula 'This all happened long ago' is substituted by that
of 'What we are going to speak of happened somewhere else, but
it might well have happened here today, and it might happen tomorrow'.
The example of Algeria is significant in this context. From 1952-3
on, the storytellers, who were before that time stereotyped and
tedious to listen to, completely overturned their traditional
methods of storytelling and the contents of their tales. Their
public, which was formerly scattered, became compact. The epic,
with its typified categories, reappeared; it became an authentic
form of entertainment which took on once more a cultural value.
Colonialism made no mistake when from 1955 on it proceeded to
arrest these storytellers systematically.

The contact of the people with the new movement gives rise to
a new rhythm of life and to forgotten muscular tensions, and develops
the imagination. Every time the storyteller relates a fresh episode
to his public, he presides over a real invocation. The existence
of a new type of man is revealed to the public. The present is
no longer turned in upon itself but spread out for all to see.
The storyteller once more gives free rein to his imagination;
he makes innovations and he creates a work of art. It even happens
that the characters, which are barely ready for such a transformation
- highway robbers or more or less antisocial vagabonds - are taken
up and remodelled. The emergence of the imagination and of the
creative urge in the songs and epic stories of a colonised country
is worth following. The storyteller replies to the expectant people
by successive approximations, and makes his way, apparently alone
but in fact helped on by his public, towards the seeking out of
new patterns, that is to say national patterns. Comedy and farce
disappear, or lose their attraction. As for dramatisation, it
is no longer placed on the plane of the troubled intellectual
and his tormented conscience. By losing its characteristics of
despair and revolt, the drama becomes part of the common lot of
the people and forms part of an action in preparation or already
in progress.

Where handicrafts are concerned, the forms of expression which
formerly were the dregs of art, surviving as if in a daze, now
begin to reach out. Woodwork, for .example, which formerly turned
out certain faces and attitudes by the million, begins to be differentiated.
The inexpressive or overwrought mask comes to life and the arms
tend to be raised from the body as if to sketch an action. Compositions
containing two, three or five figures appear. The traditional
schools are led on to creative efforts by the rising avalanche
of amateurs or of critics. This new vigour in this sector of cultural
life very often passes unseen; and yet its contribution to the
national effort is of capital importance. By carving figures and
faces which are full of life, and by taking as his theme a group
fixed on the same pedestal, the artist invites participation in
an organised movement.

If we study the repercussions of the awakening of national consciousness
in the domains of ceramics and pottery-making, the same observations
may be drawn. Formalism is abandoned in the craftsman's work.
Jugs, jars and trays are modified, at first imperceptibly, then
almost savagely. The colours, of which formerly there were but
few and which obeyed the traditional rules of harmony, increase
in number and are influenced by the repercussion of the rising
revolution. Certain ochres and blues, which seemed forbidden to
all eternity in a given cultural area, now assert themselves without
giving rise to scandal. In the same way the stylisation of the
human face, which according to sociologists is typical of very
clearly defined regions, becomes suddenly completely relative.
The specialist coming from the home country and the ethnologist
are quick to note these changes. On the whole such changes are
condemned in the name of a rigid code of artistic style and of
a cultural life which grows up at the heart of the colonial system.
The colonialist specialists do not recognise these new forms and
rush to the help of the traditions of the indigenous society.
It is the colonialists who become the defenders of the native
style. We remember perfectly, and the example took on a certain
measure of importance since the real nature of colonialism was
not involved, the reactions of the white jazz specialists when
after the Second World War new styles such as the be-bop took
definite shape. The fact is that in their eyes jazz should only
be the despairing, broken-down nostalgia of an old Negro who is
trapped between five glasses of whisky, the curse of his race,
and the racial hatred of the white men. As soon as the Negro comes
to an understanding of himself, and understands the rest of the
world differently, when he gives birth to hope and forces back
the racist universe, it is clear that his trumpet sounds more
clearly and his voice less hoarsely. The new fashions in jazz
are not simply born of economic competition. We must without any
doubt see in them one of the consequences of the defeat, slow
but sure, of the southern world of the United States. And it is
not utopian to suppose that in fifty years' time the type of jazz
howl hiccupped by a poor misfortunate Negro will be upheld only
by the whites who believe in it as an expression of nigger-hood,
and who are faithful to this arrested image of a type of relationship.

We might in the same way seek and find in dancing, singing, and
traditional rites and ceremonies the same upward-springing trend,
and make out the same changes and the same impatience in this
field. Well before the political or fighting phase of the national
movement an attentive spectator can thus feel and see the manifestation
of new vigour and feel the approaching conflict. He will note
unusual forms of expression and themes which are fresh and imbued
with a power which is no longer that of invocation but rather
of the assembling of the people, a summoning together for a precise
purpose. Everything works together to awaken the native's sensibility
and to make unreal and inacceptable the contemplative attitude,
or the acceptance of defeat. The native rebuilds his perceptions
because he renews the purpose and dynamism of the craftsmen, of
dancing and music and of literature and the oral tradition. His
world comes to lose its accursed character. The conditions necessary
for the inevitable conflict are brought together.

We have noted the appearance of the movement in cultural forms
and we have seen that this movement and these new forms are linked
to the state of maturity of the national consciousness. Now, this
movement tends more and more to express itself objectively, in
institutions. From thence comes the need for a national existence,
whatever the cost.

A frequent mistake, and one which is moreover hardly justifiable
is to try to find cultural expressions for and to give new values
to native culture within the framework of colonial domination.
This is why we arrive at a proposition which at first sight seems
paradoxical: the fact that in a colonised country the most elementary,
most savage and the most undifferentiated nationalism is the most
fervent and efficient means of defending national culture. For
culture is first the expression of a nation, the expression of
its preferences, of its taboos and of its patterns. It is at every
stage of the whole of society that other taboos, values and patterns
are formed. A national culture is the sum total of all these appraisals;
it is the result of internal and external extensions exerted over
society as a whole and also at every level of that society. In
the colonial situation, culture, which is doubly deprived of the
support of the nation and of the state, falls away and dies. The
condition for its existence is therefore national liberation and
the renaissance of the state.

The nation is not only the condition of culture, its fruitfulness,
its continuous renewal, and its deepening. It is also a necessity.
It is the fight for national existence which sets culture moving
and opens to it the doors of creation. Later on it is the nation
which will ensure the conditions and framework necessary to culture.
The nation gathers together the various indispensable elements
necessary for the creation of a culture, those elements which
alone can give it credibility, validity, life and creative power.
In the same way it is its national character that will make such
a culture open to other cultures and which will enable it to influence
and permeate other cultures. A non-existent culture can hardly
be expected to have bearing on reality, or to influence reality.
The first necessity is the re-establishment of the nation in order
to give life to national culture in the strictly biological sense
of the phrase.

Thus we have followed the break-up of the old strata of culture,
a shattering which becomes increasingly fundamental; and we have
noticed, on the eve of the decisive conflict for national freedom,
the renewing of forms of expression and the rebirth of the imagination.
There remains one essential question: what are the relations between
the struggle - whether political or military - and culture? Is
there a suspension of culture during the conflict? Is the national
struggle an expression of a culture? Finally, ought one to say
that the battle for freedom, however fertile *a posteriori*
with regard to culture, is in itself a negation of culture? In
short is the struggle for liberation a cultural phenomenon or
not?

We believe that the conscious and organised undertaking by a colonised
people to re-establish the sovereignty of that nation constitutes
the most complete and obvious cultural manifestation that exists.
It is not alone the success of the struggle which afterwards gives
validity and vigour to culture; culture is not put into cold storage
during the conflict. The struggle itself in its development and
in its internal progression sends culture along different paths
and traces out entirely new ones for it. The struggle for freedom
does not give back to the national culture its former value and
shapes; this struggle which aims at a fundamentally different
set of relations between men cannot leave intact either the form
or the content of the people's culture. After the conflict there
is not only the disappearance of colonialism but also the disappearance
of the colonised man.

This new humanity cannot do otherwise than define a new humanism
both for itself and for others. It is prefigured in the objectives
and methods of the conflict. A struggle which mobilises all classes
of the people and which expresses their aims and their impatience,
which is not afraid to count almost exclusively on the people's
support, will of necessity triumph. The value of this type of
conflict is that it supplies the maximum of conditions necessary
for the development and aims of culture. After national freedom
has been obtained in these conditions, there is no such painful
cultural indecision which is found in certain countries which
are newly independent, because the nation by its manner of coming
into being and in the terms of its existence exerts a fundamental
influence over culture. A nation which is born of the people's
concerted action and which embodies the real aspirations of the
people while changing the state cannot exist save in the expression
of exceptionally rich forms of culture.

The natives who are anxious for the culture of their country and
who wish to give to it a universal dimension ought not therefore
to place their confidence in the single principle of inevitable,
undifferentiated independence written into the consciousness of
the people in order to achieve their task. The liberation of the
nation is one thing; the methods and popular content of the fight
are another. It seems to me that the future of national culture
and its riches are equally also part and parcel of the values
which have ordained the struggle for freedom.

And now it is time to denounce certain pharisees. National claims,
it is here and there stated, are a phase that humanity has left
behind. It is the day of great concerted actions, and retarded
nationalists ought in consequence to set their mistakes aright.
We, however, consider that the mistake, which may have very serious
consequences, lies in wishing to skip the national period. If
culture is the expression of national consciousness, I will not
hesitate to affirm that in the case with which we are dealing
it is the national consciousness which is the most elaborate form
of culture.

The consciousness of self is not the closing of a door to communication.
Philosophic thought teaches us, on the contrary, that it is its
guarantee. National consciousness, which is not nationalism,
is the only thing that will give us an international dimension.
This problem of national consciousness and of national culture
takes on in Africa a special dimension. The birth of national
consciousness in Africa has a strictly contemporaneous connexion
with the African consciousness. The responsibility of the African
as regards national culture is also a responsibility with regard
to African-Negro culture. This joint responsibility is not the
fact of a metaphysical principle but the awareness of a simple
rule which wills that every independent nation in an Africa where
colonialism is still entrenched is an encircled nation, a nation
which is fragile and in permanent danger.

If man is known by his acts, then we will say that the most urgent
thing today for the intellectual is to build up his nation. If
this building up is true, that is to say if it interprets the
manifest will of the people and reveals the eager African peoples,
then the building of a nation is of necessity accompanied by the
discovery and encouragement of universalising values. Far from
keeping aloof from other nations, therefore, it is national liberation
which leads the nation to play its part on the stage of history.
It is at the heart of national consciousness that international
consciousness lives and grows. And this two-fold emerging is ultimately
the source of all culture.
