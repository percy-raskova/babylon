  "text": "The October Revolution of 1917 stands as the archetypal revolutionary success, demonstrating the conditions under which proletarian power can triumph over bourgeois hegemony. The material basis of this success lay in the particular configuration of Russian class forces during the crisis of World War One. As John Reed observed from the streets of Petrograd, the property-owning classes were becoming more conservative while the masses of the people were becoming more radical. This divergence of class trajectories created a revolutionary situation.\n\nThe Provisional Government found itself suspended between two irreconcilable forces. The bourgeoisie and moderate socialists sought to consolidate the February Revolution and contain its energy within parliamentary forms. But among the worker, soldier, and peasant masses, there was a stubborn feeling that the first act was not yet played out. The material demands were clear and immediate: Peace for the soldiers dying in imperialist slaughter, Land for the peasants facing dispossession, Bread for the workers and their families starving in the cities, and Workers Control of Industry against the capitalists who locked out workers and sabotaged production.\n\nThe Bolsheviks distinguished themselves by taking these crude, simple desires of the workers, soldiers, and peasants, and from them building their immediate program. While the moderate socialists involved themselves in compromise with the propertied classes, the Bolsheviks captured the Russian masses by aligning revolutionary theory with material necessity. All Power to the Soviets became not merely a slogan but the organizational form through which dual power could be resolved in favor of the working class.\n\nThe situation of dual power was decisive. The Soviets represented direct working class organization, while the Provisional Government represented bourgeois legality. This contradiction could not persist indefinitely. The masses deserted the moderate socialists who had collaborated with the bourgeoisie and went over to the Bolsheviks. By September 1917, the metropolitan workers, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, and the soldiers had been won almost entirely to the revolutionary cause.\n\nThe lesson embedded in this historical moment reveals that revolutionary success requires several simultaneous conditions: an acute crisis delegitimizing existing state authority, material conditions creating mass suffering among the proletariat and peasantry, a revolutionary party capable of articulating mass demands as revolutionary program, and organizational forms through which the working class can exercise power directly. When these conditions align and solidarity among the exploited classes overcomes their divisions, revolution becomes possible.",
