  "text": "The collapse of the Weimar Republic and the rise of National Socialism represents the archetypal counter-revolutionary resolution to capitalist crisis. The material conditions that produced this outcome were not accidental but emerged from the specific class configuration of Germany in the interwar period. The German proletariat, exhausted by years of failed revolutionary attempts and betrayed by Social Democracy, found itself unable to mount effective resistance. As Trotsky observed, Social Democracy had opened the era of counter-revolution before the revolution could bring its work to completion.\n\nThe petty bourgeoisie, comprising nearly half the German nation, became the decisive mass force. Ruined by inflation, economic crisis, and the predations of monopoly capital, this class developed a particular fury born of downward mobility. Not every exasperated petty bourgeois could have become Hitler, but a particle of Hitler was lodged in every exasperated petty bourgeois. Their sharp grievances of small proprietors never out of bankruptcy, of university sons without posts, of daughters without dowries demanded order and an iron hand.\n\nCrucially, German fascism raised itself to power on the backs of the petty bourgeoisie, which it turned into a battering ram against the organizations of the working class and the institutions of democracy. The political art of National Socialism consisted in fusing the petty bourgeoisie into oneness through its common hostility to the proletariat. Yet fascism in power is least of all the rule of the petty bourgeoisie. On the contrary, it is the most ruthless dictatorship of monopoly capital. Finance capital used the desperation of the middle classes as an instrument of class warfare against organized labor.\n\nThe disunity of the German working class proved fatal. The Social Democrats clung to parliamentary illusions while the Communist Party, following Stalinist directives, refused united front tactics against fascism. This fragmentation meant that at the moment of crisis, no unified proletarian response existed. The material basis for revolutionary consciousness had been undermined by years of wages supplemented by imperial rent, creating a labor aristocracy with interests aligned more closely with its own bourgeoisie than with the international proletariat.\n\nThe lesson encoded in this historical moment is stark: when economic crisis creates mass immiseration but working class organizations remain divided and weakened, when the petty bourgeoisie is mobilized by national rather than class identity, the conditions favor fascist resolution. The contradiction between capital and labor is resolved not through proletarian revolution but through the destruction of independent working class organization itself.",
