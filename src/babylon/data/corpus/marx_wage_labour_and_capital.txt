WAGE LABOUR AND CAPITAL
By Karl Marx
1849

INTRODUCTION

On April 5th, 1849, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung began the publication of a series of articles by Marx under the heading "Wage Labour and Capital". The articles were intended to popularise some of the basic elements of political economy, especially as regards the relationship between wage labour and capital.

THE NATURE AND GROWTH OF CAPITAL

What is capital? It is not merely a sum of commodities, of exchange values; it is the sum of the commodities, the exchange values, the social magnitudes of which constitute capital. Capital consists of raw materials, instruments of labour, and means of subsistence of all kinds, which are employed in producing new raw materials, new instruments and new means of subsistence. All these components of capital are products of labour, the creations of human labour, accumulated labour. Accumulated labour that serves as a means of new production is capital.

So say the economists.

What is a Negro slave? A man of the black race. The one explanation is as good as the other.

A Negro is a Negro. He only becomes a slave in certain relations. A cotton-spinning jenny is a machine for spinning cotton. It becomes capital only in certain relations. Torn from these relationships it is no more capital than gold in itself is money or sugar the price of sugar.

In production, men not only act on nature but also on one another. They produce only by co-operating in a certain way and mutually exchanging their activities. In order to produce, they enter into definite connections and relations with one another and only within these social connections and relations does their action on nature, does production, take place.

THE PRINCIPAL CONTRADICTION OF CAPITALISM

The principal contradiction of capitalism lies in the relationship between capital and wage labour. The capitalist pays for labour power at its value, but extracts surplus value by making the worker labour beyond what is necessary to reproduce the value of their wages. This difference - surplus value - is the source of all profit, rent, and interest.

The worker sells their labour power as a commodity. The value of labour power, like that of every other commodity, is determined by the labour time necessary for its production. This includes the means of subsistence necessary to maintain the worker and reproduce the working class.

But capital is not merely command over labour. It is essentially the command over unpaid labour. All surplus-value, whatever particular form (profit, interest, or rent) it may subsequently crystallise into, is in substance the materialisation of unpaid labour-time.

THE EXPLOITATIVE RELATION

Imperial rent flows from the periphery to the core through unequal exchange. The value produced by workers in the periphery transfers to the metropole through the mechanisms of international trade, foreign investment, and debt servicing.

The survival calculus of the worker under capitalism is simple: they must acquiesce to exploitation or risk starvation. P(S|A) - the probability of survival given acquiescence - depends on whether wages exceed subsistence costs. P(S|R) - the probability of survival given resistance - depends on the ratio of organisation to repression.

When P(S|R) exceeds P(S|A), revolutionary consciousness emerges. This is the fundamental equation of class struggle.

THE GENERAL LAW OF CAPITALIST ACCUMULATION

Accumulation of capital is, therefore, increase of the proletariat. The accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole.

The law of the falling tendency of the rate of profit does not abolish the capitalist law of motion but ensures that capitalist crises become more frequent and severe, until the contradictions of the system explode in revolution.

The expropriation of the direct producers was accomplished with merciless vandalism, and under the stimulus of passions the most infamous, the most sordid, the pettiest, the most meanly odious. Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent labouring-individual with the conditions of his labour, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labour of others.

As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the labourers are turned into proletarians, their means of labour into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet, then the further socialisation of labour and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form.

That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the labourer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many labourers. This expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of capitalistic production itself, by the centralisation of capital.
