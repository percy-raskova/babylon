# Game Defines - Single Source of Truth for Simulation Coefficients

# This file externalizes all "magic numbers" from Python code, enabling:
# 1. Game designers to balance the simulation without touching code
# 2. Scenario-specific coefficient overrides
# 3. Clear documentation of what each number means
