"""The production opposition catalog: Babylon's five bound contradictions.

:func:`build_default_registry` wires an
:class:`~babylon.dialectics.core.opposition.OppositionRegistry` over
:class:`GraphInputs` — a small frozen snapshot the engine's
``ContradictionSystem`` fills once per tick from the live graph. Keeping
the snapshot as pre-extracted views (not the graph itself) keeps this
module free of any ``babylon.engine`` import, so the dialectics package
stays a pure downstream of ``formulas`` + ``models`` and cannot form an
import cycle with the system that consumes it.

The five oppositions, and the honest measure each is bound to on this
branch (verified against a 30-tick single-county bridged probe,
2026-07-02):

- ``capital_labor`` — mean wealth-asymmetry over EXPLOITATION edges
  (labor = pole A / source, capital = pole B / target). Antagonistic.
- ``wage`` — mean wealth-asymmetry over WAGES edges, re-oriented to the
  SAME (labor = A, capital = B) convention as ``capital_labor`` so the
  balance sign is uniform (positive = capital dominant). Its rate is the
  crisis signal ``ConsciousnessSystem`` reads.
- ``tenancy`` — tenant wealth (A) vs the territory's ``rent_level`` (B)
  over TENANCY edges, with a degenerate guard: a territory charging no
  rent (``rent_level`` ~ 0) has NO tenancy contradiction, so the pair
  contributes 0.0 rather than the wealth-vs-0 form's spurious 1.0.
- ``atomization`` — gap = :func:`atomization_index` of the SOLIDARITY
  subgraph (1 = fully atomized), balance = ``2*cylinder_balance - 1`` so
  −1 is the atomized pole and +1 the unified pole.
- ``imperial`` — core↔periphery. The bridged world seeds no periphery
  entities, so this binds a NULL measure (gap 0, balance 0); Phase D
  rebinds it to the value-form defect Φ (the wage⇄value counit defect).

Design note (pole naming): the design contract names the ``wage`` poles
"price-of-labor-power" ⇄ "value-produced" — the true wage⇄value adjunction
defect (Fundamental Theorem: W_c > V_c). No per-edge "value produced"
scalar is persisted yet, so the honest available proxy is the WAGES-edge
endpoint wealth-asymmetry; Phase D replaces it. We therefore label the
poles for what is actually measured (labor ⇄ capital) and record the
aspirational reading in the spec's ``unity`` string.
