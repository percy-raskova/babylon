"""Per-bridge reference-data cache for the spec-066 bridged headless runner.

Spec: 069-sqlite-cache-optimization.

The spec-066-bridged headless runner's ``persist_tick`` step opens fresh
``sqlite3.Connection`` instances per ``(county, tick)`` for two
reference-data lookups (population, employment-proxy). The returned
values are invariant within a calendar year, so under the weekly
cadence (``year = start_year + tick // 52``) the same fetch is
re-executed 51 redundant times before the year rolls over.

This module lifts those reads out of the per-tick path into a
hydrate-once, year-keyed cache resident on the bridge instance. At
``WorldStateBridge.hydrate_initial`` time, the cache issues batched
SQL queries against ``data/sqlite/marxist-data-3NF.sqlite`` under a
single connection (Census-by-(fips, year), QCEW-by-(fips, year))
collectively touching each ``(county_fips, year)`` tuple in scope
exactly once. Every ``persist_tick`` thereafter reads from the
in-memory dict; no new SQLite connection is opened on the per-tick
path.
