"""The Archive TUI shell: boots into the campaign lobby, or a sample page.

Demonstrates the WO-5 shell wired together — the ksbc theme, the fenced
directive dispatch, the wikilink content spans, and the ``babylon://``
router — on a small sample page rather than any live projection data (that
wiring is WO-3/WO-7). Headless-runnable via ``App.run_test()``.

Program v1.0.0 Unit C2 adds the Screen-mode boot flow: lobby -> briefing ->
campaign shell. ``ArchiveApp(campaign_menu=..., campaign_loader=...)`` pushes
:class:`~babylon.tui.campaign_menu.LobbyScreen` on mount; once it dismisses
with a chosen campaign UUID, ``campaign_loader`` (the structural
``CampaignLoader`` seam, fulfilled for real by
:mod:`babylon.game.session`'s composition-root factories) boots or resumes
that exact campaign, :class:`BriefingScreen` shows its vault-baked Scenario
Briefing, and dismissing THAT reveals the campaign shell — the very same
dossier/breadcrumbs/status widgets ``compose()`` always mounts, now reading
the live campaign's own vault instead of the built-in demo page. With no
``campaign_menu`` given (the default), none of this runs: ``ArchiveApp()``
boots straight into the sample dossier exactly as before — every existing
caller/test is unaffected.

Unit C3 adds the paced tick driver's own structural seam
(:class:`PacedDriverHandle`) alongside :class:`CampaignHandle`: when the
composition root also supplies ``driver_factory``, the campaign shell's
``t``/``r``/``a`` bindings route through
:mod:`~babylon.game.pacing`'s :class:`~babylon.game.pacing.PacedTickDriver`
(explicit single-tick advance, run-until-paused auto-play, and the
autopause-ack flow) instead of calling :attr:`ArchiveApp.campaign` directly
— never a hard import of ``babylon.game``, only this module's own Protocol.
With no ``driver_factory`` given (the default), :attr:`ArchiveApp.driver`
stays ``None`` and ``t`` behaves exactly as it did before this unit —
existing callers/tests are unaffected.

Program v1.0.0 Unit U1 (live-campaign navigation) closes the gap left by
Unit C2's own ``known_entities``/``_resolver`` docstrings: booting a live
campaign used to swap :attr:`ArchiveApp._pages` but never the demo
:data:`KNOWN_ENTITIES` fixture set, so wikilink classification and the
command palette (:class:`~babylon.tui.palette.EntityNavigatorProvider`)
kept speaking the demo entities on every real ``babylon play`` boot —
real baked pages were unreachable except by direct ``Ctrl-O``/``Ctrl-I``
jumplist replay. :meth:`CampaignHandle.known_subjects` is the new
enumeration seam; :meth:`ArchiveApp._on_campaign_chosen` rebuilds
``known_entities``/``_resolver`` from it right after swapping ``_pages``,
and every successful ``t``/``r`` tick advance re-scans it again (cheap
frozenset compare, skipped when unchanged) so pages baked mid-campaign
become navigable immediately. The demo (no-``campaign_menu``) boot path is
completely unaffected.

Program v1.0.0 T6 Unit U4 (the guided opening-arc overlay — not to be
confused with the earlier, unrelated "Unit U1" above) adds
``tutorial_steps``/``tutorial_progress_factory``: when both are given,
:meth:`ArchiveApp._on_campaign_chosen` builds this campaign's
:class:`~babylon.tui.tutorial_overlay.TutorialProgress` seam, and
:meth:`ArchiveApp._on_briefing_dismissed` mounts a
:class:`~babylon.tui.tutorial_overlay.TutorialOverlay` over the freshly-
revealed campaign shell IFF that seam is not ``None`` (the composition
root's own new-vs-resumed gating — see ``babylon.cli.play``). Every
committed-tick action (``t``/``r``/``a``) and every navigation event
(``Ctrl-O``/``Ctrl-I``/palette pick/wikilink follow — all of which route
through :meth:`ArchiveApp._navigate`) re-polls the mounted overlay via
:meth:`ArchiveApp._refresh_tutorial_progress` — as does, since Program 24 P8
("the tutorial learns the shell"), every pane switch (``1``-``4``,
:meth:`ArchiveApp.action_switch_view`) and every watchlist pin/unpin
(``p``, :meth:`ArchiveApp.action_toggle_pin`), the same trigger-path idiom
extended to the two new :class:`~babylon.game.tutorial.PaneShowing`/
:class:`~babylon.game.tutorial.PinnedInWatchlist` completion kinds. With no
``tutorial_progress_factory`` given (the default), nothing here runs at
all — every pre-Unit-U4 caller/test, and the demo boot path, is completely
unaffected.

Program 24 P5 (the bottom action bar) closes :data:`_ACTION_BAR_ABSENT`'s own
"feed wires in at Program 24 P2-P6" note: :meth:`ArchiveApp._refresh_action_bar`
paints the ``#action-bar`` pane with :meth:`CampaignHandle.verb_plate_view`'s
live :class:`~babylon.projection.verbs.view_models.VerbPlateView` (mirroring
:meth:`_refresh_dashboard`'s own projection-purity shape) on boot and on every
``t``/``r`` tick, and :meth:`ArchiveApp.action_issue_verb` (bound to ``F1``-``F9``,
see :data:`_VERB_ACTION_KEYS`) is the FIRST real write the player can make on
the world from this shell: an eligible verb reaches
:meth:`CampaignHandle.issue_verb`; an ineligible one shows its already-rendered
refusal without ever attempting the write. With no live :attr:`campaign` (the
demo boot path) or a composition root that declines to wire
:meth:`CampaignHandle.verb_plate_view`, the pane keeps its honest absence fence
— unaffected, same as every other pane's Program 24 P1 default.

Program 24 P6 (the right rail) wires :attr:`ArchiveApp.watchlist` — a
:class:`~babylon.tui.watchlist.WatchlistState` pin/unpin domain object,
persisted through :data:`~babylon.tui.watchlist.WatchlistPersistence` (the
``babylon_meta``-backed store the composition root already threads in as the
campaign catalog — the WO-37 structural trick) — to the ``#watchlist-rail``
pane P1 left painting its own honest "nothing pinned yet" fence.
:meth:`ArchiveApp.action_toggle_pin` (bound to ``p``) pins/unpins
:attr:`nav`'s current subject; :meth:`ArchiveApp._refresh_watchlist` stacks a
:func:`~babylon.tui.peek.peek` ``depth=0`` stat plate per pinned subject via
:func:`~babylon.tui.watchlist.watchlist_rows`, resolving each id through
:meth:`ArchiveApp._resolve_subject_view`. A pin outside what that resolves
renders the rail's own named "no longer resolvable" row rather than a crash
or a silent drop (Constitution III.11).

Unit "watchlist-row-nav" (shell-interconnect) makes ``#watchlist-rail``
row-addressable: it is a :class:`~textual.widgets.OptionList` now (was a
plain ``Static``), one selectable option per pinned row, keyboard
``up``/``down``/``home``/``end`` first-class (its own ``BINDINGS``) and a
single mouse click equally first-class (hover never load-bearing, R3).
Enter or a click on a row opens that pinned subject's own dossier via
:meth:`ArchiveApp.on_option_list_option_selected` -> :meth:`ArchiveApp.
_navigate` — :attr:`WatchlistState.pinned_ids` is already the exact
subject-id form ``_navigate``/``read_page`` consume, so the opened page is a
real baked vault page (or ``_navigate``'s own honest absence page), never a
fixture, even before a live per-subject peek producer exists.

Unit "live-subject-view" (shell-interconnect) retires that last fixture
dependency for a booted campaign: :meth:`ArchiveApp._resolve_subject_view`
now calls :meth:`~babylon.tui.app.CampaignHandle.subject_view` —
:meth:`~babylon.game.session.GameSession.subject_view`, dispatching over the
ten already-existing Lane P ``project_<kind>`` functions, computed fresh off
the live graph every call (mirroring :meth:`CampaignHandle.dashboard_view`'s
own contract) — falling back to the committed-fixture
:func:`_default_subject_views` map ONLY for the no-``campaign_menu`` demo
boot path, which has no live campaign to ask.

       own "bold GOLD" style; the four domain panes below use crimson
       ($primary) titles by contrast, a pre-existing, intentional difference
       this unit does not touch. border-title text is set dynamically, once
       per repaint (ArchiveApp._apply_shell_chrome_titles at boot,
       _refresh_watchlist/_refresh_action_bar on every live update —
       _refresh_chronicle never touches it: the tick number now lives
       inline in the body text itself, one header line per bulletin, so a
       single static rail-level title is enough). border-subtitle carries a
       static copy-affordance hint: the already-live but undiscoverable
       ctrl+c/super+c Screen.copy_text binding (screen.py:272, show=False)
       — mouse-drag a selection on any of these three rails, then copy it.
       Kitty's own Shift+drag (terminal-native selection, bypassing
       Textual's mouse reporting entirely) remains the escape hatch for the
       #dashboard/#wiki panes, which are NOT bare Text/Content widgets and
       so are NOT part of this unit — a documented {absence}, not a code
       fix (see ArchiveApp._apply_shell_chrome_titles' own docstring).

       Unit "watchlist-row-nav" (shell-interconnect): #watchlist-rail LEFT
       this bare-Text/get_selection family — it is a row-addressable
       textual.widgets.OptionList now (own BINDINGS + click-to-select, never
       a Static), which does not implement get_selection the way a bare
       Static(Text(...)) did. Its own border-subtitle is
       ArchiveApp._WATCHLIST_OPEN_HINT, not _COPY_HINT — see that constant's
       docstring. The border/border-title-color rules just below still apply
       to it unchanged (they are plain CSS, not tied to the widget class). */

       own title tab breaking the top border line ("┤ TITLE ├" idiom) — a
       bold crimson label chipped on a panel-tone backing. #wiki is the one
       scrollable content region among the four, so it gets the doc's
       "inner well" double border instead of the others' single plate
       border; #dashboard-hud nests inside #dashboard's own plate (ample

    /* Unit "focus-model" (shell-interconnect): the focus ring itself. Textual's

       auto-focuses the FIRST focusable widget in DOM/focus-chain order at
       screen-activation time — before this unit that was unconditionally the
       Wiki pane's bare VerticalScroll (WikiView, the ONLY focusable widget
       anywhere in this shell's tree), regardless of which of the four panes
       was actually visible, because every rail and the other three domain
       panes were plain non-focusable Static/Widget content.
       ArchiveApp.compose now sets can_focus=True on each rail instance
       (_UNPANELED_RAIL_IDS) and on the Dashboard/Map/Topology pane instances
       — Wiki keeps focusing its own pre-existing VerticalScroll instead of
       gaining a second, redundant stop on the WikiView container itself.
       DESIGN_BIBLE's selection grammar (inverse video + gold) is reserved for
       widget FOCUS styling, never OS text selection (a different mechanism,
       see the "selection-unwrap" unit above) — $accent (gold) is exactly that
       role, so a heavy gold border is what marks "this is where your
       keypresses go right now", legible against the panes'/rails' own resting
       crimson ($primary) chrome. */
