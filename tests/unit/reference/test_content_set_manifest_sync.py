"""Sync guard for the content-set manifest (``rust/crates/babylon-tick/content/
content-sets.toml``, issue #652 Task 4, plan §4).

Every ``.bscn`` scenario in ``babylon-tick``'s content estate is loaded
together with a specific rule pack (and sometimes a shared declaration
prelude) by one or more ``include_str!`` call sites scattered across the
crate's ``src/`` and ``tests/`` directories. That pairing was previously
recoverable only by reading the Rust source: two files can ``include_str!``
the SAME scenario and rule pack (siblings), one file can pair one scenario
with several rule files, and a prelude's presence is discoverable only from
a header comment. Convention (filename stems) does not recover it — see
plan §4.2's own counterexamples. The manifest makes the pairing an explicit,
transcribed fact; this guard keeps it from drifting silently out of sync
with the Rust source it was transcribed from.

Today the Rust call sites are the source and the manifest is the one-time
transcription (Task 4.2). Going forward the manifest is the declaration and
the call sites are its mirror — the two containments below (rows 2 and 3)
together mean neither side can drift without the other noticing:

1. every ``scenario``/``prelude``/``rules``/``consumers`` path a row names
   exists on disk;
2. **Rust ⊆ manifest** — every content path an ``include_str!`` call site
   under ``rust/crates/babylon-tick/{src,tests}/*.rs`` declares is covered
   by the union of every manifest row that names that file as a consumer;
3. **manifest ⊆ Rust** — every row's ``consumers`` files exist and each one
   really does ``include_str!`` that row's ``scenario``, every one of its
   ``prelude`` entries, and every one of its ``rules`` (an empty
   ``consumers`` list requires a non-empty ``note`` explaining why);
4. **no invisible content** — every ``.bsl``/``.bscn`` file under
   ``content/**`` is claimed by at least one row (as ``scenario``,
   ``prelude``, or a ``rules`` entry) or is named in ``[orphans]`` with a
   reason — this is how a file nobody wires up yet (the #646 landmine
   class) stays VISIBLE instead of latent;
5. **ids are unique and appear in ascending byte order** — a duplicate id
   is a collision caught mechanically rather than by a reviewer noticing,
   and a stable sort order keeps diffs to the manifest small and readable.

Rows 2 and 3 are set-containment checks per consumer file, not literal
tuple-formation: a file's `include_str!` constants might pair scenario A
with rule pack B in one test and scenario C with rule pack D in another
(``tick_goldens.rs`` is the extreme case — nine independent pairs in one
file), so the guard does not try to rediscover WHICH scenario goes with
WHICH rule from the Rust source; that pairing is exactly the fact the
manifest transcribes by hand. What the guard verifies mechanically is that
the set of paths a file actually ``include_str!``s and the set of paths the
rows naming that file as a consumer claim for it are the same set — either
side having something the other lacks is drift.

Known blind spot of that reading (task-4 review, 2026-08-18): two disjoint
single-rule rows sharing one consumer file could have their ``rules`` values
SWAPPED — each row then lies about its scenario's pairing while the per-file
union stays identical, and every row here still passes. No such crossed
pairing exists in the committed data; a future editor adding sibling rows
under one consumer should not rely on this guard to catch a cross-wiring.

Modelled on ``test_bsl_grammar_sync.py``'s containment discipline (:13-33).
