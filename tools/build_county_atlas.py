"""Build the county atlas the Bevy client renders (Program 28 B1, Phase A).

Turns the sha-pinned ``dim_county_geometry`` parquet (TIGER/Line 2024 county
boundaries, EPSG:4269) plus the committed ``county_adjacency.json`` into ONE
content-hashed binary at
``rust/crates/babylon-client/assets/map/county_atlas.bin``.

Why a build-time artifact at all: Amendment AF (i)/(iv) ships the game as a
pure Rust binary, so the deleted Ratatui client's "ask Python for WKT over
FFI" geometry seam no longer exists. Geometry has to arrive as a committed
asset. The repository carries the atlas; CI never builds it, exactly as
``src/babylon/data/game/county_adjacency.json`` already establishes.

Determinism: counties sort by FIPS ascending, rings run exterior-first then
holes in input order, no Python ``set`` is ever iterated, and the tool builds
the whole artifact twice and asserts byte-identity before writing (disable
with ``--skip-determinism-check`` only when iterating locally).

Nothing transcendental crosses the language boundary at runtime: the
cartographic projection runs HERE, at build time, and bakes into u16 grid
units the Rust reader turns back into metres with one multiply and one add.

Usage::

    mise run data:county-atlas
    uv run python tools/build_county_atlas.py --sources <dir> --out <path>

Sources resolve to ``dist/data-artifacts/`` when it exists (rebuild it with
``mise run data:artifacts``), otherwise the pinned drive snapshot at
``/media/user/data/babylon-data/backups/data-artifacts-v7/``. The tool prints
the sha256 of every input it read -- put that in the commit body.

Binary format, version 1. All integers little-endian. The Rust reader checks
every offset and count against the file length BEFORE any loop uses it
(Power-of-10 rule 2: no loop may take its bound from an unchecked number read
out of a file)::

      centroid    [u16; 2]   grid units
      pad         [u8; 2]    reconciles the field list to the 28-byte stride

    name blob       u32 length, then UTF-8 "<county_name>, <state_abbrev>\\n"
                    per county in order

Rings are stored WITHOUT the WKT closing duplicate vertex, so a ring of ``n``
stored vertices tessellates to ``n - 2`` triangles and the whole atlas to
``vertex_count - 2 * ring_count``. A county's rings run in polygon order:
every ``is_hole == 0`` ring opens a new polygon and the ``is_hole == 1`` rings
that follow belong to it, which is exactly the grouping ``earcut`` needs.

``flags`` bit 0 records "this county has at least one neighbour in
``county_adjacency.json``". The committed adjacency artifact records PAIRS
only, and its county universe is the same ``dim_county_geometry`` universe
this tool reads, so an empty CSR row is a real answer (island counties exist)
rather than a coverage hole. The report lists every empty row by FIPS so the
answer stays visible instead of silent.
