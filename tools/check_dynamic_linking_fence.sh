# R1.4 fence, workflow-visible half (Director ruling 2026-08-18, BSL
# refactor program plan §14: "bevy/dynamic_linking — RULED: APPROVED WITH
# FENCE"). bevy's dynamic_linking feature is an OPT-IN, LOCAL-ITERATION-ONLY
# convenience for babylon-client (`mise run rust:client-dev-dylib`) — faster
# incremental Bevy rebuilds via libbevy_dylib.so. It must NEVER ride a CI,
# release, or pin-ceremony build: the .so is not meant to ship, and every
# gate build must prove the ordinary (statically-linked, default-features)
# path. This script is the static/textual half of the fence; rust/crates/
# babylon-client/tests/dynamic_linking_fence.rs is the compiled half
# (asserts the feature is off in whatever build ran the test suite).
#
# Matches ACTIVATION syntax only (`--features ... dynamic_linking` /
# `--all-features`), never the bare word — this file, ci.yml's own step
# name, and every task description below are free to keep SAYING
# "dynamic_linking" in prose without tripping the gate; only something that
# would actually turn the feature ON does.
#
# Round 1 (2026-08-18, task-fix1-report.md) fixed the original quote-blind
# regex with a character-class allowlist that deliberately excluded `-`.
# Round 2 (2026-08-18, task-fix1-review.md) found that exclusion breaks on
# a LEGAL cargo feature name containing a hyphen sitting between
# `--features` and `dynamic_linking` in the same list —
# `--features "some-feature,dynamic_linking"` evaded round 1's regex
# entirely, and the unquoted `--features=another-thing,dynamic_linking`
# form evaded it too even though the ORIGINAL pre-round-1 regex caught
# that one (a real regression, introduced by the hyphen exclusion). The
# review also flagged a pre-existing, unrelated gap: a shell
# line-continuation split (`--features \` / newline / `dynamic_linking`)
# evades any line-oriented grep no matter what the character class allows,
# since neither physical line alone contains both the flag and the word.
#
# Both are fixed by abandoning the single-regex approach for invariants 1
# and 2 in favor of a small awk program (embedded below via a heredoc into
# a temp file, `$AWK_JOIN_MATCH`) that:
#   1. Joins backslash-continuation lines into one logical line first, so
#      a split activation can no longer hide between two physical lines.
#   2. Scans each logical line for `--all-features`, or for `--features`
#      (`=`-joined or space-joined) followed by its ACTUAL argument —
#      bounded by the real quote characters (`"`, `'`, or TOML's
#      `\"`-escaped form, which this repo's own .mise.toml already uses)
#      when quoted, or by the next whitespace when not — never by a
#      character-class guess. Cargo feature names may legally contain
#      hyphens (also `_`, `.`, `+`); bounding the argument by its real
#      shell/TOML delimiters instead of an allowlisted character class
#      means a hyphenated sibling feature name no longer breaks the scan,
#      with no need to special-case `-` (or any other legal feature-name
#      character) at all.
#   3. Only checks the EXTRACTED ARGUMENT for `dynamic_linking` — so the
#      bare-word non-match property still holds: `--features foo`
#      followed later on the same line by an unrelated comment mentioning
#      "dynamic_linking" still never trips it, because the argument
#      boundary correctly stops at the whitespace after `foo`, before the
#      comment is ever reached.
# Verified directly against /usr/bin/grep and real awk (GNU Awk 5.2.1),
# never the interactive shell's grep-as-ugrep wrapper — see
# task-fix1-report.md's round 2 section for the full drill matrix.
#
# Checks, offline and in-repo:
#   1. No GitHub Actions workflow ever activates dynamic_linking (an
#      explicit `--features ... dynamic_linking` or a blanket
#      `--all-features`) — a workflow IS a CI/release/pin-ceremony build.
#   2. .mise.toml activates dynamic_linking ONLY inside the sanctioned
#      local-dev task's own `run` line (rust:client-dev-dylib) — any other
#      task's `run` doing so (rust:check included) is a leak into the gate.
#   3. No rust/**/Cargo.toml lists dynamic_linking inside a `default = [...]`
#      features array — default-on would silently activate it for every
#      plain `cargo build`/`test`, including CI's.
# Exit 0 clean / 1 violation found / 2 error.

# Shared join+extract program for invariants 1 and 2 (design rationale in
# the header above). Written to a temp file via a QUOTED heredoc
# (<<'AWKSCRIPT') so the shell performs zero expansion/escaping on its
# body — the program needs literal ", ', \, and $ characters for its own
# quote/whitespace-boundary detection and awk's own field syntax, and a
# quoted heredoc is the only embedding form that avoids a three-way fight
# between shell single-quotes, awk string-literal escaping, and POSIX ERE
# escaping (a real problem: round 1's ACTIVATION_RE lived entirely inside
# shell single-quotes and never needed a literal `'`; this program does,
# to detect `'...'`-quoted arguments).
# MODE="line" (invariant 2, single file) prints "startline:logical",
# matching plain `grep -n`'s single-file output format, so invariant 2's
# existing sanctioned-line diff logic below needs no other change. Any
# other MODE (invariant 1, multi-file via find -exec) prints
# "FILENAME:startline:logical", matching `grep -rn`'s multi-file format.
