"""Repo-hygiene gate: allowlisted root, no tracked-ignored files, no fat blobs.

Program 14 (Correspondence) Phase 0.5. Enforces three invariants, loudly
(Constitution III.11 — no silent degradation):

a. **Root allowlist** — every *tracked* top-level entry must appear in
   ``ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_DIRS`` or ``ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_FILES``. Untracked local
   state (``.venv``, ``data/`` mount symlinks, caches) is ``.gitignore``'s
   jurisdiction, not this gate's.
b. **No tracked-but-ignored files** — the failure mode that let 70 MB of
   ``reports/`` artifacts ride in git (ignore rules added after commit, index
   never purged). The ``.gitkeep`` convention (tracked keeper inside an
   ignored directory) is exempt.
c. **No tracked blob over 1 MiB at HEAD** — LFS pointers are ~130-byte blobs,
   so blob size alone separates pointers from real heavyweights; a >1 MiB
   blob is either missing an LFS attribute or missing a renormalize. Named
   exemptions live in ``LARGE_BLOB_EXEMPTIONS`` (grown only with a per-entry
   owner-visible justification comment).

Run: ``uv run python tools/check_repo_hygiene.py`` (wired into
``mise run check`` as ``check:hygiene`` and into CI). Exit 0 = clean,
1 = violations (printed), 2 = git itself failed.
