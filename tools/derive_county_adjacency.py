"""Derive the county-adjacency artifact from pinned TIGER geometry (ADR179 T1).

Produces ``src/babylon/data/game/county_adjacency.json``: every unordered pair
of US counties whose TIGER/Line 2024 boundaries touch, derived from the
``geometry_wkt`` column the reference DB already carries (itself loaded from
the Phase 0-D pinned shapefile by ``tools/ingest_tiger_geometry.py``).

Follows ``tools/generate_us_county_territories.py``'s artifact discipline
exactly: schema-versioned, provenance-stamped, content-hashed JSON committed
in-repo, so the engine never touches the data drive at runtime (the ADR121
precedent; CI/tests read the artifact, never the drive).

Determinism: shapely predicates over fixed WKT text are deterministic, pairs
are emitted sorted, and the probe run confirmed two passes produce identical
sets. ``intersects`` and ``touches`` were verified EQUIVALENT on this dataset
(zero pairs with overlapping interiors — TIGER county polygons are
topologically clean), so the faster ``intersects`` is used with a loud check
that the equivalence still holds per pair.

Usage::

    uv run python tools/derive_county_adjacency.py

Then commit the artifact; ``babylon.domain.geography.adjacency`` verifies the
stamp at load and fails loud on drift.
