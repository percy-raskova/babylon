"""Generate the deterministic USScenario county-seed artifact.

Owner ruling 2026-07-19 (Amendment U / #39 T4 blocker adjudication): re-keying
``USScenario``'s territories from res-3 H3 hexes to counties needs real
per-county population + geography, never fabricated numbers -- but the
scenario builder (``engine/scenarios/_legacy.py::_create_us_territories``)
must stay reference-DB-free at build/test time (measured cost: ~6.6s per
national-scope population lookup via
:class:`babylon.engine.headless_runner.reference_data_cache.ReferenceDataCache`,
paid at >130 call sites across the test suite if done live -- e.g.
``tests/unit/web/test_engine_bridge.py``'s ``_make_mock_persistence()``).
Per the deterministic-data-artifacts doctrine (CI never touches the data
drive) -- the SAME doctrine that motivated
``src/babylon/data/game/business_seeds.json`` /
``tools/generate_business_seeds.py`` for the QCEW business seeds -- this
``tools/`` script precomputes the per-county rows from
``data/sqlite/marxist-data-3NF.sqlite`` into a committed, hash-stamped JSON
artifact (``src/babylon/data/game/us_county_territories.json``) that
``babylon.engine.scenarios.us_county_data`` reads at runtime.

**Scope**: the same national county universe the headless runner uses
(:func:`babylon.engine.headless_runner.scopes._load_national_fips` --
state fips < '60', excludes the synthetic ``{state}999`` rest-of-state
placeholders), FIPS-sorted.

**Population policy (follows the house consumer, byte-for-byte)**: Census
``fact_census_income`` household-count SUM is primary; QCEW
``fact_qcew_annual`` employment SUM x 0.33 is the fallback -- this is
literally :class:`~babylon.engine.headless_runner.reference_data_cache.
ReferenceDataCache`'s own resolution rule, reused directly (not
reimplemented) so the artifact can never drift from what
``WorldStateBridge`` already treats as the real per-county population.
``population_year`` is 2010: it matches ``WorldStateBridge.hydrate_initial``'s
default ``start_year`` and empirically has the best coverage of the national
scope among the years checked (2010/2015/2018/2019/2020) -- the exact
counties Census/QCEW genuinely never covers (AK/CT post-1990 geography
splits) are named in the committed artifact's own ``gaps`` list, not
restated here to avoid drift.

**Centroid policy**: ``dim_county_geometry.centroid_lat``/``centroid_lon``,
real TIGER centroids (NOT the fabricated hex-cell centroids the old h3 grid
used). A small number of scoped counties lack a geometry row (a different,
non-overlapping set from the population gap) -- also recorded in ``gaps``.

**Retired-FIPS dedup (2026-07-19, scout finding; extended 2026-07-20, T4
review finding I-1)**: ``dim_county`` carries BOTH a retired FIPS and its
modern successor(s) as separate rows for the SAME physical county/area, in
two distinct forms:

- **Rename** (:data:`_RETIRED_FIPS_SUPERSEDED`, one successor each):
  ``46113`` (Shannon County, SD) -> ``46102`` (Oglala Lakota County, SD --
  2015 Census Bureau rename); ``02270`` (Wade Hampton Census Area, AK) ->
  ``02158`` (Kusilvak Census Area, AK -- 2015 Census Bureau rename, the exact
  same class of duplicate as Shannon/Oglala Lakota).
- **Split** (:data:`_RETIRED_FIPS_SPLIT`, two successors -- a rename map
  cannot express two successors): ``02261`` (Valdez-Cordova Census Area, AK)
  dissolved in 2019 into BOTH ``02063`` (Chugach Census Area) and ``02066``
  (Copper River Census Area) per Census Bureau change notice; the retired
  whole plus both halves are all present in ``dim_county``.

All pass ``_load_national_fips``'s scoping filter, so the raw national scope
double- (rename) or triple- (split) counts these areas. :func:`_dedup_retired_fips`
drops a retired key ONLY when ALL of its successor(s) are present in the same
extraction -- recorded in the artifact's ``exclusions`` list, never silently
dropped. A generator self-check asserts NO key from the union of both maps
survives dedup, failing loud (Constitution III.11) rather than shipping a
duplicated artifact.

These are declared, cited maps, NOT generic rename/split detection: if a
similar duplicate surfaces later, a map is extended with its own citation,
not inferred. Generic inference is deliberately out of scope -- e.g.
``51515``/``51019`` (Bedford city / Bedford County, VA) are correctly NOT
deduped: both were legitimately separate entities at the 2010 reference year
(Bedford city didn't merge into Bedford County until 2013), so a name- or
geography-based heuristic would wrongly collapse two real counties into one.
``engine.headless_runner.scopes._load_national_fips`` itself carries the
same latent double/triple-count for the nationwide headless-runner path --
that is a separate, pre-existing production defect, OUT of this script's
scope (flagged for a follow-up task, not fixed here).

Only the RAW reference-derived fields are baked into the artifact
(``fips``, ``county_name``, ``state_abbrev``, ``centroid_lat``/``lon``,
``population``, ``raw_material_value_millions``). The pure, in-memory
sector/rent/biocapacity/region classification (``_classify_hex``/
``_compute_metro_influence``/``_get_region_name`` in ``_legacy.py``) stays
runtime logic -- it needs no DB access and predates this artifact (Wayne's
untouched precedent uses the identical hand-authored classification style),
so precomputing its output here would only bloat the artifact without
adding real data.

**Raw-material value policy (2026-07-20, #39 T6, schema_version 2)**:
``fact_state_minerals.value_millions`` (USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries,
Program 22 Wave 1, 50 states -- no energy or biocapacity reference-data
source exists, see ``engine/systems/substrate.py``) allocated state -> county
by land-area share: ``county_share = area_sq_km / Σ(area_sq_km over the
state's scoped counties with a geometry row)``. This is the same
apportionment key ``persistence/hex_hydrator.py`` already uses for
raw-material stocks ("follows AREA -- where mining + extraction happens").
A county's ``raw_material_value_millions`` is ``None`` (recorded in
``gaps``) when its state has no ``fact_state_minerals`` row (DC, PR -- USGS
covers the 50 states only) or the county itself has no
``dim_county_geometry`` row (no area to allocate a share from) -- never a
fabricated default.

Regeneration::

    poetry run python tools/generate_us_county_territories.py               # year 2010
    poetry run python tools/generate_us_county_territories.py --year 2019

The output is deterministic: counties are FIPS-sorted and every query is a
GROUP BY / ORDER BY over stable keys, so identical DB inputs yield an
identical artifact (identical ``content_hash``). Commit the regenerated
JSON and note the new hash.
