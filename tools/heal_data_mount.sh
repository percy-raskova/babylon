# One-command heal for the data-mount displacement class of failure
# (reports/incident-2026-07-13-data-mount-displacement.md). Run as root:
#
#   sudo tools/heal_data_mount.sh [--with-fstab]
#
# What it does, in order (each step verified, refuses loudly on surprises):
#   1. dump the shadow Postgres cluster onto the real drive (insurance),
#   2. stop the Postgres container,
#   3. move the root-fs shadow dir aside to /media/user/ (stays visible),
#   4. unmount the drive from its displaced mountpoint,
#   5. mount it at the expected mountpoint (+ optional fstab hardening),
#   6. restart Postgres against the real cluster and verify the lineage.
# The shadow data is never deleted — disposal is the owner's call afterwards.
