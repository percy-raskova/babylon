"""FIPS vintage crosswalk artifact generator (#334 Phase 0, A1 + guard G7).

Reconciles two independent county universes and the ACS-2019 (``time_id=23``,
``fact_census_poverty``) data-availability gaps between them, then emits a
small, hand-authored, checked-in crosswalk:

- **The engine universe** — ``src/babylon/data/game/us_county_territories.json``
  (3,153 counties, current TIGER-vintage FIPS).
- **The resolver universe** — ``babylon.engine.headless_runner.scopes.
  _load_national_fips`` against ``dim_county`` (3,156 counties; admits three
  retired FIPS the engine artifact does not: ``02261`` Valdez-Cordova,
  ``02270`` Wade Hampton, ``46113`` Shannon).

Every engine-universe county absent from ``fact_census_poverty`` at
``time_id=23`` (14 counties, verified against the read-only reference DB —
see "Deviation from the plan's framing" below for the verification queries'
findings) gets a crosswalk row, classifying it into exactly one of:

``DECLARED_HOLE``
    Zero ``fact_census_poverty`` rows under **any** FIPS code this county has
    ever held, at **any** ``time_id``. Never a valid crosswalk target (G7).
    Verified for ``46102`` Oglala Lakota SD (Pine Ridge; predecessor ``46113``
    carries rows only 2010-2014) and ``02158`` Kusilvak Census Area AK
    (predecessor ``02270`` Wade Hampton likewise carries rows only 2010-2014
    — the identical administrative pattern as Pine Ridge, verified this pass;
    see "Deviation from the plan's framing" below).
``SPLIT_UNRESOLVED``
    A single predecessor with full 2019 data was split into two-or-more
    current engine counties (``02063`` Chugach + ``02066`` Copper River, both
    ex ``02261`` Valdez-Cordova, effective 2019). The predecessor's 2019
    headcount is population for the *combined* pre-split territory and
    cannot be disaggregated between the successors without the deleted
    census extractor (``data-catalog.yaml:1096``) — attributing it wholesale
    to either successor would double-count that population if both rows
    fed a summed national total (the exact failure mode G7's injectivity
    check exists to catch), so both rows carry ``recoverable=false`` with
    the known-but-unusable source disclosed informationally.
``REORGANIZATION_UNRESOLVED``
    Connecticut's 2022 replacement of 8 counties with 9 planning regions
    (``09110``...``09190``) is a genuine many-to-many restructuring, not a
    set of 1:1 renames or clean splits — confirmed against the CT Data
    Collaborative / zip-codes.com correspondence: every planning region
    draws territory from 2-3 of the 8 former counties, and no county is the
    sole source of any single region. No single-FIPS predecessor can be
    assigned per region without fabricating precision the underlying
    geography does not support, so all 9 rows carry ``recoverable=false``.
``RENAME_RECOVERABLE``
    A clean, exclusive, unambiguous 1:1 predecessor with full 2019 data
    (``51515`` Bedford city VA, reverted to a town and annexed wholly into
    Bedford County ``51019`` in 2013 — verified: ``51019`` carries full 2019
    rows and no other county's territory is involved).
``RESOLVER_ONLY``
    A FIPS the resolver's ``dim_county``-based universe admits but the
    engine's territory list does not carry at all (``02261``, ``02270``,
    ``46113`` — the three-FIPS universe-size delta). These are documentation
    rows recording *why* the resolver (3,156) and engine (3,153) universe
    sizes differ by exactly 3, not ACS-recovery rows.

**Deviation from the plan's framing, verified this pass (2026-08-17) against
the read-only reference DB** (``data/sqlite/marxist-data-3NF.sqlite``,
``mode=ro``): the plan's proposal source
(``reports/national-oppression-proposal.md:127-136``) and the implementation
plan's T1 section characterize the 13 non-hole absences as uniformly
"recoverable" (grouping ``02063/02066/02158`` together as "3 AK
reorganizations" and all 9 CT regions as recoverable via "09001...09015").
Direct queries against ``fact_census_poverty`` show this does not hold for
**7 of those 13**:

- ``02158`` Kusilvak has **zero** rows at any ``time_id`` under either its own
  FIPS or its named predecessor ``02270`` (which stops at 2014, exactly
  mirroring Pine Ridge/``46113``) — reclassified ``DECLARED_HOLE``, not
  recoverable. G5 (T3b, downstream) already forbids imputing ``46102`` from
  ``46113``'s stale 2010-2014 rows; the identical logic forbids imputing
  ``02158`` from ``02270``'s equally-stale rows, so treating one as a hole
  and the other as recoverable would be an inconsistent standard.
- ``02063``/``02066`` share a single legitimate source (``02261``) that
  cannot be independently attributed to each successor without either
  fabricating a disaggregation or double-counting the shared population
  under G7's injectivity guard — reclassified ``SPLIT_UNRESOLVED``.
- The 9 CT planning regions have **no** 1:1 predecessor at all (verified: a
  genuine many-to-many correspondence, not merely an 8-vs-9 counting
  mismatch) — reclassified ``REORGANIZATION_UNRESOLVED``.

Only ``51515`` (Bedford city VA) survives as genuinely, unambiguously
``recoverable=true``. This does **not** change the row count (still 17: 14
engine-domain absence rows + 3 resolver-only delta rows) or any of F1-F7's
national-aggregate findings (all are dominated by large-population counties;
these are a handful of small Alaska/CT counties). It changes downstream
consumers' expectations: T4's derivation must **not** treat ``02063``,
``02066``, or ``02158`` as recovered-via-crosswalk. Flagged prominently in
``task-1-report.md`` for Director/reviewer visibility — this is a factual
correction against the plan's stated row classification, not a scope change.

This tool does NOT write ``data-artifacts.yaml`` (T5's job; ADR121
hand-maintained-artifact pattern, mirroring
``tools/make_faf_bloc_tons_artifact.py``) — it prints the manifest block for
hand-entry. ``tests/unit/tools/test_fips_vintage_crosswalk.py`` carries G7's
guard tests (``TestMutationG7``) plus the universe-enumeration checks.
