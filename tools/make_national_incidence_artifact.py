"""National-incidence artifact generator — sha-pinned source access, the
full derivation pipeline, and A2/A3 emission (#334 Phase 0, T2-T4).

Plan: ``docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-334-incidence-artifact.md`` §3 (the
derivation), §2 (A2/A3 shapes). T2 implemented plan §3's steps 1-2 (universe
resolution + filtered cell pull); T3a landed the four arithmetic-law guards
(:func:`ratio_of_sums` G1, :func:`classify_zero_denominator` G2,
:func:`assert_t_pole_exactness` G6, :func:`overlap_upper_bound` G8); T3b
landed the three absence/small-count guards (:func:`damp` +
:func:`compute_damped_sigma` G3, :func:`classify_suppression` +
:func:`classify_absence` G4, :func:`reconcile_absence_counts` +
:func:`assert_no_pine_ridge_imputation` G5). **T4 wires every guard into the
full per-county measure pipeline** (steps 3-9) and emits A2
(:func:`build_county_pole_rows` + :func:`write_county_pole_artifact`) and A3
(:func:`build_reproduction_floor_rows` + :func:`write_reproduction_floor_artifact`)
deterministically. G7 already shipped with T1 (``tools/make_fips_vintage_crosswalk.py``).
Registration (``data-artifacts.yaml``/``data-catalog.yaml`` entries) is T5's job —
this module only prints the manifest blocks for hand-entry.

ADR098 circularity, resolved the same way T1 states it: these are
**second-order products** derived from **registered parquet sources**
(``dist/data-artifacts/*.parquet``), never from the sqlite build product
directly. **There is no ``--from-sqlite`` derivation path.** The sqlite file
(``data/sqlite/marxist-data-3NF.sqlite``) is touched in exactly two places,
neither of which is "derive the poverty measures from it":

1. ``--export-source`` mode (:func:`export_source_tables`) — PRODUCES the
   registered parquet sources by calling
   ``make_data_artifacts.export_table_parquet``, the ONLY sanctioned
   parquet-writing path (``tools/make_data_artifacts.py:389-409``). This is
   how a fresh box materializes ``dist/data-artifacts/fact_census_poverty.
   parquet`` — ``dist/`` is gitignored, so the parquet is absent until this
   runs. Hard-gated on the pinned SQLite runtime (mirrors
   ``tools/build_reference_db.py``'s identical gate) — an off-pin export
   risks producing bytes that don't match the registered
   ``data-artifacts.yaml`` sha256 pins, which is exactly the kind of silent
   drift step 2 below exists to catch, so it's caught earlier and louder
   here instead. Run inside ``mise run nix -- ...``
   (``docs/how-to/reference-data-pipeline.rst:10-17``).
2. The ``scopes`` universe (:func:`_scopes_universe`) reuses
   ``babylon.data.reference_scope._load_national_fips`` directly —
   the same call ``tools/make_fips_vintage_crosswalk.py`` (T1) already
   makes. This is universe-**membership** enumeration against
   ``dim_county`` (which FIPS codes exist), never a ``fact_census_poverty``
   **measure** read. It is not the circularity the ``--from-sqlite``
   prohibition closes off.

Every actual **derivation** read — the filtered poverty cells
(:func:`read_filtered_poverty_cells`) and the ``unrestricted`` universe
(:func:`_unrestricted_universe`) — reads ONLY the sha-pinned parquet sources,
verified by :func:`verify_source_provenance` BEFORE any of those reads
happen. Mismatch or a missing source raises :class:`SourceProvenanceError`,
loud, no fallback.

**Pinned filters** (OQ11: pinned 2019 vintage, never re-cut — the extractor
that could re-cut a different vintage was deleted,
``data-catalog.yaml:1096``): ``time_id=23`` (2019), ``category_id in {1, 2}``
(1 = ``B17001_001`` "Total" = the universe *u*; 2 = ``B17001_002``
"below poverty" = *b*), ``race_id in {1, ..., 10}`` — **widened from the
plan's literal ``{1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10}`` by a controller ruling at T4** (the
plan's own guard register self-contradicts: G6 needs the seven
mutually-exclusive ``A..G`` parts (race_id 2-8) to check ``T == Σ(A..G)``,
which the narrower filter never pulls). The single pyarrow pull now carries
all ten race_id values — T, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I — so G6's exactness
check runs on the REAL pulled cells; the pole derivation (T4) then selects
its four-pole subset (B/C/I/H) downstream, never re-querying. Race codes:
1=T Total, 2=A White alone, 3=B Black, 4=C AIAN/Indigenous, 5=D Asian,
6=E NHPI, 7=F Some other race, 8=G Two or more races, 9=H
White-non-Hispanic/settler reference, 10=I Hispanic/Chicano — **note the
pole-letter trap**: the charter's B/C/I nation-pole letters are NOT these
census race codes; Chicano resolves to census ``I`` (race_id 10), Indigenous
to census ``C`` (race_id 4). Plan §0.).

**A1 applied** (step 1's other half, plan §3): the checked-in crosswalk CSV
(``src/babylon/data/reference/national/county_fips_vintage_crosswalk.csv``,
T1) is **the authority** — loaded directly by :func:`load_crosswalk`, never
re-derived from ``tools/make_fips_vintage_crosswalk.py``'s in-module
``CROSSWALK_ROWS`` constant. :func:`resolve_query_fips` is the concrete
application: a ``recoverable=true`` row substitutes its ``fips_acs2019``
target (Bedford ``51515`` -> ``51019``) as the FIPS to query
``fact_census_poverty`` under; every other engine-universe county —
including ``DECLARED_HOLE`` rows (``46102``, ``02158``) and the
non-recoverable ``SPLIT_UNRESOLVED``/``REORGANIZATION_UNRESOLVED`` rows
(``02063``, ``02066``, the 9 CT planning regions) — queries its own native
FIPS, which for those rows simply returns no data. **T1's report is binding
here**: 02063/02066/02158 must NOT be treated as crosswalk-recovered.
Classifying *why* a county has no data (``ROW_ABSENT`` vs ``DECLARED_HOLE``
vs ``SUPPRESSED``) is G4/T3b's job, not this resolver's — T2 computes
nothing.

**Universe-variant naming, a verified deviation from the plan's literal
strings:** plan §2 A3 names the three ``universe_variant`` enum values
``artifact_3153``, ``scopes_3140``, ``unrestricted_3218``. T1 already
measured the scopes (resolver) universe at **3,156**, not 3,140
(``task-1-report.md``; re-confirmed directly against the read-only
reference DB this pass — see ``task-2-report.md``). Rather than propagate a
verified-wrong count into an identifier three tasks are going to read,
:func:`resolve_universe_variants` returns plain semantic keys (``artifact``
/ ``scopes`` / ``unrestricted``) with the real measured size available from
``len(variant.fips)`` — T4 (A3's emitter) owns picking the final
``universe_variant`` column strings and should use the measured number.

#: (whose true rate ≈0.22 is well above the flat 0.10 reference), a genuine
#: zero is LESS surprising than the flat-rate model believes, so this
#: classifier UNDER-FLAGS suppression there (some true suppressions read as
#: PRESENT). On the settler pole (true rate ≈0.10, close to the reference),
#: the flat rate is roughly accurate; on any pole whose true rate is well
#: BELOW 0.10, the classifier would OVER-FLAG suppression (genuine zeros
#: misread as SUPPRESSED). Net: this policy is conservative in the wrong
