"""Reference SQLite CI-subset generator (Program 14/15 Phase 6, owner item 40).

The reference database (``data/sqlite/marxist-data-3NF.sqlite``) is 5.7 GB —
too large to check into git or fetch cheaply on every CI run. This tool
builds a much smaller, byte-reproducible subset for CI (target: comfortably
under the 2 GB GitHub release-asset ceiling) by applying a reviewable,
module-level table policy (:data:`TABLE`) to every table in the source:

* ``"full"`` — copy every row (small dimension/bridge tables, tiny national
  fact tables, and three tables real tests assert *national* coverage over —
  the "BLOCKED-FULL" trio: ``dim_county_geometry``, ``fact_bea_county_gdp``,
  ``fact_qcew_county_rollup``).
* ``"michigan"`` — copy only rows tied to a Michigan county (state FIPS
  ``26``), via one or more ``county_id``-typed FK columns resolved against
  ``dim_county.fips``. May also carry a reviewable REGRESSION-GUARD
  CARVE-OUT (``extra_fips``) — a fixed list of non-Michigan county FIPS
  codes a specific test depends on (e.g. ``fact_qcew_annual``'s spec-098
  0-vs-None guard row) that would otherwise be dropped by the state filter.
* ``"skip"`` — drop the table entirely, documented with a reason (either it
  is read by nothing in ``src/`` or CI-relevant tests, or a sibling recon
  confirmed its real content is never read in any test).

Every ``fact_``/``dim_``/``bridge_`` table in the source MUST have a policy
entry. An unclassified table matching those prefixes is a hard, loud error
(Constitution III.11) — the trove growing a new table must force policy
review, not silently ship the table full, subsetted, or dropped by accident.

Source DB is opened genuinely read-only (SQLite ``mode=ro`` URI) — this
tool never writes to it, and the OS/driver enforces that even if the code
did not.

Usage::

    poetry run python tools/make_reference_subset.py \\
        --output /path/to/reference-subset.sqlite \\
        --manifest /path/to/manifest.json
