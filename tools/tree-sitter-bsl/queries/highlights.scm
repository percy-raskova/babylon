;; Syntax highlighting for BSL — DERIVED, NON-NORMATIVE.
;;
;; docs/reference/bsl-language.rst is the one normative home; this file
;; colours what ../grammar.js parses and declares nothing about the
;; language. Capture names follow the tree-sitter/nvim-treesitter standard
;; set so the queries drop into any host that speaks it.
;;
;; The colouring intent, stated once: a reader should be able to see the
;; three things BSL makes load-bearing — WHICH FORM this is (the head), WHAT
;; IT READS (qnames, enum-refs, metric and binding names), and WHICH
;; QUANTITY KIND a literal carries (§1.5's four suffixes are the lexical
;; enforcement of the no-bare-floats rule, so they are highlighted as a
;; class of their own rather than as generic numbers).
